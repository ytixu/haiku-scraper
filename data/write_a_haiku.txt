the eclipse is nigh \ tomorrow the moon conceals \ shadow over us
school is 10 months long \ each day we learn something new \ school can help us grow

a stunning singer \ a person who has no friends \ a five foot four beast
an unstable lunatic \ a raging, feral, creature \ me in a nutshell
the thing that you like \ proudly stuck on your bumper \ i hate it, and you too
boy seems weird responds \ without punctuation it \ someone please help him
calm rain sad quiet \ slowly dripping tears locked up \ inside gloomy sad
a new pull request \ another contribution \ travis causes tears
beautiful flowers \ take care of them and they grow \ neglect them, they die
happy birthday, son! \ although you're now a man you'll \ always be my boy.
more than a husband \ a baby daddy a friend \ you complete my day.

saltwater, stoic \ deadly, attacking waves leap \ eyes wide, gunships crash
frozen lanterns are \ good in dark, on street where no \ dog no longer bark.
while we pray in warmth \ a man freezes on the streets \ without an address
