Grasses wilt: / the braking locomotive / grinds to a halt.
The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough.
... lifting my cup, / I asked the moon / to drink with me ...
And if Li Po had / got the moon in his mitts / what would he have done with it?
While you decline to cry, / high on the mountainside / a single stalk of plumegrass wilts.
Hush, cawing crows; what rackets you make! / Heaven's indignant messengers, / you remind me of wordsmiths!
Onyx, this gem-black night. / Downcast, I await your return / like the morning sun, unrivaled in splendor.
Snow-obscured heights, / mist-shrouded slopes: / this spring evening.
Soundlessly they go, / the herons passing by: / arrows of snow / filling the sky.
O, fluttering moon, / if only we / could hang a handle on you, / what a fan you would be!
An orphaned blossom / returning to its bough, somehow? / No, a solitary butterfly.
Life: a solitary butterfly / swaying unsteadily on a slender stalk of grass, / nothing more. But so exquisite!
Fire under the ash / and written on the wall / the shadow of a friend
Fire levitating ashes: / my companion's shadow / animates the wall ...
This darkening autumn: / my neighbor, / how does he continue?
Autumn darkness / descends / on this road I travel alone
Lightning / shatters the darkness― / the night heron's shriek.
An ancient pond, / the frog leaps: / the silver plop and gurgle of water.
A crow settles / on a withered branch: / autumn nightfall.
My eyes, / having observed everything, / returned to the white chrysanthemums.
A white swan / parts the cherry-petalled pond / with her motionless breast.
Useless dreams, alas! / Over desolate fields / winds whisper as they pass.
Observe: / see how the wild violets bloom / within the forbidden fences!
Leaves, like the shadows of crows / cast by a lonely moon.
A kite floats / at the same place in the sky / where yesterday it floated ...
Standing beneath cherry blossoms / who can be strangers?
Overdressed for my thatched hut: / a peony blossoms.
Oh, magnificent peony, / please don't disdain / these poor surroundings!
Insolent peony! / Demanding I measure your span / with my fan?
"This big!" / The child's arms / measured the peony.
Peonies blossom; / the world is full of fibbers.
Sing, my sacred tortoiseshell lyre; / come, let my words / accompany your voice
Dark-bosomed clouds / pregnant with heavy thunder ... / the water breaks
The butterfly / perfuming its wings / fans the orchidd
Pausing between clouds / the moon rests / in the eyes of its beholders
Oh, fallen camellias, / if I were you, / I'd leap into the torrent!
Eros harrows my heart: / a wind on desolate mountains / uprooting oaks.
when you opened / my letter / were you surprised / my heart / fell out?
next door / the lovemaking / subsides / stars fall / from other worlds
an old photo / of my parents / young and happy— / of all the things I own / that is the saddest
One apple, alone / In the abandoned orchard / reddens for winter
Our life here on earth: / to what shall we compare it? / It is not like a rowboat / departing at daybreak, / leaving no trace of us in its wake?
Graven images of long-departed gods, / dry spiritless leaves: / companions of the temple porch
The temple bells grow silent / but the blossoms provide their incense― / A perfect evening!
See: whose surviving sons / visit the ancestral graves / white-bearded, with trembling canes?
Does my soul abide in heaven, or hell? / Only the sea gull / in his high, lonely circuits, may tell.
Mariner, do not ask whose tomb this may be, / but go with good fortune: I wish you a kinder sea.
I remove my beautiful kimono: / its varied braids / surround and entwine my body
This day of chrysanthemums / I shake and comb my wet hair, / as their petals shed rain
Let us arrange / these lovely flowers in the bowl / since there's no rice
The first soft snow: / leaves of the awed jonquil / bow low
Come, investigate loneliness! / a solitary leaf / clings to the Kiri tree
The first chill rain: / poor monkey, you too could use / a woven cape of straw
This snowy morning: / cries of the crow I despise / (ah, but so beautiful!)
Like a heavy fragrance / snow-flakes settle: / lilies on rocks
The cheerful-chirping cricket / contends gray autumn's gay, / contemptuous of frost
Whistle on, twilight whippoorwill, / solemn evangelist / of loneliness
The year's first day ... / thoughts come, and with them, loneliness; / dusk approaches.
An empty road / lonelier than abandonment: / this autumn evening
Ballet in the air!― / two butterflies, twice white, / meet, mate, unite.
High-altitude rose petals / falling / falling / falling: / the melody of a waterfall.
The cicada's cry / contains no hint to foretell / how soon it must die.
Fever-felled mid-path / my dreams resurrect, to trek / through a hollow land
The sea darkening, / the voices of the wild ducks: / my mysterious companions!
Will we meet again? / Here at your flowering grave: / two white butterflies
These wilting summer flowers? / The only remains / of "invincible" warriors ...
Spring has come: / the nameless hill / lies shrouded in mist
Among the graffiti / one illuminated name: / Yours.
A spring wind / stirs willow leaves / as a butterfly hovers unsteadily.
Swallow flitting in the dusk, / please spare my small friends / buzzing among the flowers!
Morning glories blossom, / reinforcing the old fence gate.
Scrawny tomcat! / Are you starving for fish and mice / or pining away for love?
The moon: glorious its illumination! / Therefore, we give thanks. / Dark clouds cast their shadows on our necks.
Curious flower, / watching us approach: / meet Death, our famished donkey.
Ah me, / I waste my meager breakfast / morning glory gazing!
Right at my feet! / When did you arrive here, / snail?
Oh, brilliant moon / is it true that even you / must rush away, as if tardy?
Ghostly the gray cow comes / mooing / mooing / mooing / out of the morning mist.
Peonies blossom; / the world is full of blooming liars.
After killing a spider, / I was overcome by loneliness / in the bittercold night.
Summer river: / ignoring the bridge, / my horse charges through the water.
After the fireworks, / the spectators departed: / how vast and dark the sky!
Such a small child / sent to become a priest: / frigid Siberia!
We cannot see the moon / and yet the waves still rise
The first morning of autumn: / the mirror I investigate / reflects my father’s face
Wild geese pass / leaving the emptiness of heaven / revealed
Silently observing / the bottomless mountain lake: / water lilies
Cranes / flapping ceaselessly / test the sky's upper limits
Falling snowflakes' / glitter / tinsels the sea
Blizzards here on earth, / blizzards of stars / in the sky
Completely encircled / in emerald: / the glittering swamp!
The new calendar!: / as if tomorrow / is assured ...
Ah butterfly, / what dreams do you ply / with your beautiful wings?
Because morning glories / hold my well-bucket hostage / I go begging for water
Spring / stirs the clouds / in the sky's teabowl
Tonight I saw / how the peony crumples / in the fire's embers
It fills me with anger, / this moon; it fills me / makes me whole
War / stood at the end of the hall / in the long shadows
Because he is slow to wrath, / I tackle him, then wring his neck / in the long grass
Pale mountain sky: / cherry petals play / as they tumble earthward
The frozen moon, / the frozen lake: / two oval mirrors reflecting each other.
The bitter winter wind / ends here / with the frozen sea
Oh, bitter winter wind, / why bellow so / when there's no leaves to fell?
Winter waves / roil / their own shadows
No sky, / no land: / just snow eternally falling ...
Along with spring leaves / my child's teeth / take root, blossom
Stillness: / a single chestnut leaf glides / on brilliant water
As thunder recedes / a lone tree stands illuminated in sunlight: / applauded by cicadas
The snake slipped away / but his eyes, having held mine, / still stare in the grass
Girls gather sprouts of rice: / reflections of the water flicker / on the backs of their hats
Murmurs follow the hay cart / this blossoming summer day
The wet nurse / paused to consider a bucket of sea urchins / then walked away
May I be with my mother / wearing her summer kimono / by the morning window
The hands of a woman exist / to remove the insides of the spring cuttlefish
The moon / hovering above the snow-capped mountains / rained down hailstones
Oh, dreamlike winter butterfly: / a puff of white snow / cresting mountains
Spring snow / cascades over fences / in white waves
A sturdy oak / In the plum orchard, / Totally indifferent / To the blossoms.
Not knowing / The name of the tree, / I stood in the flood / Of its sweet smell.
Having sucked deep / In a sweet peony, / A bee creeps / Out of its hairy recesses.
From Jerusalem the Golden / by Charles Reznikoff
In the street I have just left / the small leaves of the trees along the gutter / were steadfast / in the blue heavens. / express / picks up speed / and a wind / blows through the car, / blows dust / on the passengers, / and along the floor / bits of paper—— / wrappers of candy, / of gum, tinfoil, / pieces of newspaper ....
Going to work in the subway / this bright May morning / you have put on red slippers; / do they dance behind the counters / in the store, or about the machines / in the shop where you work?
Rails in the subway, / what did you know of happiness, / when you were ore in the earth; / now the electric lights shine upon you.
What are you doing in our street among the automobiles, / horse? / How are your cousins, the centaur and the unicorn?
Rooted among roofs, their smoke among the clouds, / factory chimneys—our cedars of Lebanon.
From the middle of the pool / in the concrete pavement a fountain / in neat jets; the wind scatters it / upon the water. The untidy trees / drop their leaves upon the pavement.
Now that black ground and bushes— / saplings, trees, / each twig and limb—are suddenly white with snow, / and earth becomes brighter than the sky, / that intricate shrub / of nerves, veins, arteries— / myself—uncurls / its knotted leaves / to the shining air.
Upon this wooded hillside, / pied with snow, I hear / only the melting snow / drop from the twigs.
Dry leaf flung awry: / bright butterfly, / goodbye!
A snake in the grass / lies, hissing / "Trespass!"
Honeysuckle / blesses my knuckle / with affectionate dew
My mother’s eyes / acknowledging my imperfection: / dejection
The whore with the pallid lips / lipsticks / into something more comfortable
I am a traveler / going nowhere— / but my how the gawking bystanders stare!
The moon in decline / like my lover’s heart / lies far beyond mine
Night, / the ice and the darkness / conspire against human warmth
Late autumn; now all / the golden leaves turn black underfoot: / soot
Lift up your head / dandelion, / hear spring roar!
How will you tidy your hair / this near / summer?
Leave to each still night / your lightest affliction, / dandruff.
Soon you will free yourself: / one shake / of your white mane.
Now there are worlds / into which you appear / and disappear
seemingly at will / but invariably blown— / wildly, then still.
Gasp at the bright chill / glower / of winter.
I cicles splinter; / sleep still an hour, / till, resurrected in power, / you lift up your head, / dandelion. / Hear spring roar!
