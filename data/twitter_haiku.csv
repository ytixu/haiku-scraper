Show me a sign \ I asked \ amp the moon smiled back..
I had to come back here \ Half burnt moon in the sky \ I had to fill in the Colour
High in the treetops \ Are the leaves shaking to fall \ off or to stay on
Head outside and walk \ to lose your way on purpose. \ Let your mind explore.

Autumn leaves blow by \ Like summer's unfulfilled dreams \ As the flowers die
Ugly \ Ugly they call me \ Curs'd and sent away
without summer's shadows \ winter is empty and lonely \ and yet even without shadows
Like what is this game \ Im not even that far in \ i think but jesus
Went back to my home. \ Found I'd never been away. \ But they had all gone.
An armadillo \ Strolls halfway through the jackal \ And the bush is rich

Beholder's bold gaze \ Why can't we target the eye \ Called shots go both ways
Britney \ including new york \ overall influencing the
new snow \ everything smooth \ in the jail yard
corner rustle \ another remix of yellow and red \ by dj october
"gave a man a quid \ this is an outrageous lie, \ one last one for now"
The crow has flown away \ a gentle wave \ into the chestnut.
"So sorry, donkeys \ My bed and the sound of rain \ delayed your breakfast"
before we can grow \ we must first work on building \ a strong foundation
Steps \ continued success \ number-one october and
harvestime \ the combine combs \ a swath of sun
chestnut rice \ I've encountered \ a whole chestnut
Halloween's coming. \ Simmer is the perfect dish. \ It's scarily good
Inevitably \ He must break the bonds of love \ To know his own strength
A bee's hello--dance \ of kisses and caresses-- \ sharing directions.
he us will should things \ who where often others as \ how always really
chestnut rice \ children eat messily \ let them do so
They are nobody-- \ A rhinoceros \ Bounds up a sparrow
"And on lonely nights, \ she basks in wondrous moonlight, \ inhaling magic."
departing autumn \ with hands spread open \ chestnut burrs
