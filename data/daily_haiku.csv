"We will miss you - \ Farewell, Mr. Vonnegut. \ I laughed; wept"
"Submissions being  \ reviewed - they're all excellent. \ Be patient, count bees"
snow dragging on - \ suicide watch starts
"walking in the snow, \ I realize that I can't  \ erase my past deeds"
"crab crawling on sand \ legs scattering, leaving marks; \ gone in the morning"
"handsack gravy flake, \ forcive transistor goog fool - \ language is play, yes?"
"April 1 is no joke \ if you're already dead, \ or close to it"
"glasses on table - \ grandpa passed in June, \ only two months away"
these young girls have \ the legs and the walk - \ none of the bruises
"trees still bare, \ stuck in November; \ t-shirts out in force"
"snow mold fading - \ green appearing, \ potholes galore."
"manhole belching early - \ three hundred days of this, \ more to come"
"lots of drink down here \ lots of skin, too - \ new moon death"
I have a book up here \ south side of town \ sands by the beach
"plane ticket to France \ like a ""fuck thou"" ode to you \ if I had the balls"
they sound like you \ every word I'm gonna say \ like jazz joints
"I'd have breakfast \ smashed in the bottle, drowned \ ghosting in, lost"
Blessed relief \ Jackie was drunk again \ Making the best
"Axes raised, bones thrown \ suddenly a crazed dumb kid \ God in the morning"
crumpled jacket on \ the back of your chair shows me \ to whom you belong
Tall black stilettos  \ Fuck-me shoes back in fashion \ STDs rising
Coarse white pubic hair \ Sign of fleeting time old age \ Now at the ready
Blue-eyed blond school girl \ Luminous smile camouflage \ For misshapen leg
Pieces of puzzle \ Young boy studies shapes colours \ Picks framework of life
Friends meet greet hug talk \ Try to stop relentless time \ From cutting them short
Spaniel run over \ Boy mourns his one and only \ Buddy his true friend
Bright new Mary-Janes   \ Lead journey to adulthood \ First day of schooling
footprints red on white \ near a vacant iron grin \ that one got away
"bursts over belt loops \ designer brand across her ass \ ""Guess"" what?... Your weight?"
relentless rush \ sliding over senseless stone \ the tide dancing
spilling mica flecks \ across cooling velvet as \ the sun sulks away
minus thirty with \ white wraiths leaping road shoulders \ glad I’m not walking
bedraggled wagon \ wet glass under overpass \ tires walk on water
with all words broken \ wails empty to ragged breaths \ apocalyphons
"she speaks in circles – \ ""Will you tell me a story?"" \ means, ""Do you love me?"""
"to touch, be touched \ is everything worth wanting \ yes, there and yes, that"
all we did was talk \ but I can smell you on me – \ smoke and seduction
"snow, freezing rain, snow \ winter teaches us patience; \ tulips, daffodils"
my cat purrs comfort \ rearranging my sock drawer \ for dapper white feet
I’d dance on his grave \ if I could just remember \ where I’d buried him
my whole family \ is in therapy for things \ we don’t talk about
"Life is hot amber, \ But what flows when all things end? \ Just Truth,  and Ice."
"Mountains, but not stone– \ White sculptures too pure for hands. \ I break like a wave."
"How do they return, \ Those who die beneath the snows? \ Storm petrel / sheathbill."
"Poured glass / mute valley, \ Ice creaks on rusty hinges– \ Weight of a white tongue."
"Snow falls like feathers; \ Down to diamonds, pressed tight– \ No room for a soul."
"Lucid awe-struck blue \ Traps the voice, leaves it hollow; \ Falling faces roar."
"Ice is poetry. \ Blunt punctuation, hard thoughts; \ Words – sharp as angles."
Time with a purpose \ makes up for what disappears \ when the clock runs down.
A photo is all \ we have of our rendezvous \ between here and there.
This late-night movie \ is not as satisfying \ as what will come next.
Beyond the river \ three abandoned cabins wait \ for erosion’s grasp.
"Five try to study \ during breaks as they drink, \ laugh, cough, smoke, and sit."
"Brandishing her phone, \ a solo conversation \ fills the moving bus."
"I took some pictures, \ and ended up on the front  \ lines of a movement."
Deadline looming; \ This haiku isn’t as good \ As it could have been
Snow on the ground \ Streetlamps are on \ At four o'clock
Cryllic spullilick \ Just remember to roll yr Я’s \ Or is it a Ya?
Another sunless day \ I don't go outside anyhow \ What's the point?
Hangover again \ Feel ashamed and broken down \ You bring the vodka tonight?
Still drunk from last night \ Morning train into Moscow \ What a wonderful world
Just \ Sitting \ Around
"Immaculate snow \ Muffles cries, camouflages \ City’s shortcomings"
"Still, white cityscape \ Belies fury of last night's \ Edmonton blizzard"
"Canadian Rockies \ Hold secrets, hopes, fossils in \ Ranges of tight pleats"
Man walks dog daily \ Past woman at her window \ Order in their world
Sparkling wrist bangles \ Call crystalline air to bear \ Witness to spirit
The sun's luscious lips \ Kiss my nape like a lover's \ Promise of pleasure
"Buds, hands, hail the sun \ A spring in pedestrians' steps \ Alberta Chinook"
"flavour sensation \ soma in my soylent green \ numb, I keep eating"
luminescent lures \ draw them close to its dark mouth \ the nightclub swallows
iron pachyderms \ rake the soil as if to say \ asphalt goes Here
gently falling down \ tucks in the filth and refuse \ cold comfort drifting
sharp stone fingers \ pulling tissue to tatters \ mountains clutching sky
he'll sleep here again \ despite the wendigo chill \ pawing through his coat
warm mechanism \ of love at rest becoming rage \ bodies colliding
every storm passes \ the world remembers to breathe \ rainbows are promises
lightning eyes flashing \ and your face darkens and clouds \ thunder comes after
"organic, fair trade \ fresh-ground, French-pressed coffee \ – cup of privilege"
hard-faced women \ complaining into cell phones \ missing the sunset
mercury dropping \ bus now forty minutes late \ I want to go home
treachery afoot \ churned oatmeal over ice \ avoid the alley
"old friends surfacing \ Vancouver, Norway, Taiwan \ happy holidays"
"Dance twirls a bright blade, \ Cleaves deep through fabric / soft flesh; \ Presses heart to heart."
"Quick steps on hard wood, \ A racing heart / shadow hips, \ Scream of passing skin."
"Red satin / legs twine, \ Dart quick as smoky heels meet. \ Smolder; freeze; tango."
Slow twilight fluid; \ Sweat and heat and bodies pass; \ Eyes flash fire – rumba.
Snowflakes / melting tears; \ Smooth spinning Vienna Night; \ Pressed tight / frozen eyes.
"Wings shift cold clear air, \ Softly beat in three/four time; \ Waltz – a heart takes flight."
"Dance drips with red ink; \ Bodies paint dreams on blank wood, \ Floor slick with desire."
"Bring me a latte: \ whole milk, extra hot, with foam \ to keep me thinking."
Winter is a birth \ of lofty expectations \ for the next season.
This pen is too small \ for the breadth of my fingers \ or the words they speak.
"I turned off my phone. \ Darkness should equal silence, \ except in my dreams."
She doesn't live here; \ moved out before the increase \ in rent and constraints.
"Breathing in the scent \ of life, and food, and romance; \ Air is recycled."
Staring at pictures \ digitized upon the screen - \ High-tech memories.
"Who is this butcher? \ Grinning, whiskey on his breath \ Russian dentist’s chair"
Elton John sings \ A Texas love song as \ First snow falls
Shitfaced with your dad \ Though no two words are understood \ The cognac does its job
Highway prostitute \ Shivering in snowy cold - \ All I can see is your breath
"Long weekend, 4th class, \ 8-hour night train to Smolensk \ Это сущий разврат (this is a veritable debauch)"
Train station at dawn \ A million foreign faces pass (me by); \ You were never on time
Lada in the rain \ Wrapped in a blanket of flame; \ Unquenchable thirst
"Spotty memories \ Dot minds, Alzheimer rubs out  \ The connecting lines"
"Time flows freely, like \ Water in a river, no \ Dam can hold it back"
"Shingles, jolts of pain, \ Zigzag stitches on his back \ Life’s calligraphy"
"Furious sparrows \ Beak to beak, flash wings, draw lines  \ Upon patio"
"Shovel of dirt hits \ Father’s casket and her heart  \ Fall leaves, winter’s here"
Endless Prairie sky \ Nowhere to hang memories \ Only beginnings
"Cold, grey October \ Clammy cloak of memories \ Father’s burial"
deep inhalation \ tasting this crisp autumn day  \ I’d kill for a smoke
dusk rain surrenders \ bright clouds bleed a war-red \ Kurosawa sky
ghost-metal hull \ steams to break the horizon \ and evapourates
torn plastic petals \ trash-bag blossom on the lawn \ all the damned magpies
"concrete pilings \ with rust-stained ends and rebar \ old, broken bones"
wet air and streets \ painted glass-black with water – \ you left this morning
blacktop tigers \ menace pedestrians \ with glass-packed snarls
winter dark mornings \ dragging my ass out of bed \ before the sun does
in the hour of foxes \ shadows slip and slink around \ edges of perception
Whyte Ave homeless man \ compliments my sexy shoes \ no change – shame on me
such shallow concerns \ my lip balm discontinued \ dread finding new brand
"wow, the man says, wow \ falling off his bicycle \ good morning to you"
a kindred magpie \ we hoard all the shiny bits \ with raucous laughter
"black umbrellas bloom \ dozens under autumn rains \ one, twirling paisley"
Hiroshima blooms \ On a dark day in August; \ Five petals falling.
Flesh gnaws at its chains. \ Tainted souls dance in rubble / \ Echoes murmur in the skin.
Dark streaks on concrete; \ Black rain washes the gutters– \ Poison in the wound.
"Towers torn to dust, \ Carried to the firmament \ By a crushing fist."
The air is on fire. \ Hades belches; furies dance; \ Buildings melt like wax.
"White light in the sky; \ The face of god shines–bright, hot \ A killing whisper."
"A speck in the blue, \ Dodging the pale clouds / guilt builds \ On a quiet day."
the cup is empty \ bringing on the dilemma \ of a refill or exit
graying sky soaring; \ a roof above the heads of \ mortal creatures beneath
"all it takes is a \ spot of sun, drop of love \ for a complete day"
before the harvest \ temperatures dropped below \ enough to finish growth
marching in unison \ crying out the calls for peace; \ my camera is my banner
"aching shoulders call \ for a break from plasma screens, \ keyboards, and deadlines"
drugged up on caffeine \ floating between sleep and day \ pouring out the words
Confusion at the deli \ Ya ne gavaroo pa-russky \ Please don’t shout at me
Familiar photos on the wall \ Remind me of who I am \ But who the fuck are they?
23rd birthday \ 3 litres of Kleenskoye - \ Thank God for light beer
Mud on my pant cuffs; \ Can’t take a step around here \ Without a wrong one
Babushka keenly watches \ Young boy’s \ First attempt at beer
One bedroom roach motel \ Windows let in the cold \ I’m far from home
Children playing; \ Yelling in a language \ I cannot understand
Silky hands of youth \ Caress old parchment faces \ Grandchildren delight
Fall’s blaze of folly \ Deposits rich red blood cells \ On winter’s bare bones
"Family pictures \ Phone calls, elderly people’s  \ Spindly bones of hope"
Your aftershave climbs \ The stairs ahead of your steps \ I inhale pleasure
"Desert wind throws sand \ Wipes steps, whips hair and welts dunes \ Rubs out man’s imprint"
Lavender bath oil \ Anoints all her crevices \ Washing him away
A soldier’s parents \ Answer call from Ottawa \ Hoping for wounded
a suckling pig \ better your head in my lap \ than in my freezer
iridescence \ painting colour in the moist air \ clouds weeping prisms
his snake eyes mirthful \ Death drives a black ambulance \ hands at ten and two
slick scales defy \ deft fingers fishing for answers; \ the question swims off
"tall cool amber brew \ wonderful, sense-deadening \ comfort in decay"
a milk-blue sky stretches \ taut on the city’s bones \ until concrete gasps
aching fingers spill \ stillborn prose to stain these leaves \ rough thoughts slouching off
cloud-wrapped swaddling \ infant sky after sunrise \ pale blue and pale pink
freshly shaved legs \ and washed my sheets today \ going to bed bliss
"tracks end, wingswept slashes \ splattering blood against snow \ here: death from above"
"it smells of spoiled \ fish and feels like death or \ thunder, waiting to break"
July afternoon \ city sky darkens with smoke \ from distant wildfires
"cheer up emo kid \ no: shrug, scowl and walk away \ I feel like brooding"
office refugees \ exclaim over marigolds \ as though miracles
The sky breaks open \ It had to happen sometime \ Why not now?
The smell of wet earth \ Streetlight halos in the rain; \ Yukatta raincoat
Alone on a hill \ Miles of angry brilliance \ (nothing but a point)
The taste of wet air \ and the sagging weight of clouds \ hang; damp on my skin
Thunder hangs on the \ Prairie dances in the darkness; \ Breaks and howls white light
Waiting for lightning \ drinking up the flat black clouds \ trying not to blink
I can taste the storm \ with its dark wings and bright eyes \ moving the heavy air
grassy field \ entices the sparrow’s flight \ to the ground
no washrooms anywhere; \ crouching behind a tree \ i can hear everything now
leaves in my teacup \ float helplessly in the sea \ i stir with my spoon
pedaling over \ a gravel road unpaved- \ we crossed a bridge
strumming the guitar \ i was given as a present; \ sounds familiar
i photographed a \ chipmunk running on the fence \ where the wood had split
open notebook \ confronts me with its blankness \ my pen is a dare
yellow carpet \ of choked leaves; \ my feet are sore
burned trees among \ the fading living: \ reminder
blue wind pushes forth; \ bugs are somewhere \ and nowhere
bison are elegant \ they should be sipping cocktails; \ wearing tuxedos
rain clouds move in; \ cool north wind makes \ coyotes smirk
buzzing hornets: \ cannot stop leaves \ from hitting ground
burning down white water: \ logdriver is so not cool \ he's no Brando
ephemera - \ that which cannot be touched \ should not matter
drowning in whiskey - \ she left again \ and keeps leaving
horsehair whips and torture; \ cowboy kisses the wrong girl \ for the tenth time
"god sweeping up - \ leaves rustle on pavement, \ move to the gutter"
restless turning; \ funnel of air \ in my bedroom
small beetle on my step \ moving with intent; \ crushed by my heel
a fall sunday  \ sits in my lap; \ october waits
Buddha in the rain \ useless statue sips his tea \ he is stone quiet.
coffee with Buddha \ I talk about my worries \ his dick-ass smile.
my daughter makes dolls \ draws and colours and names them \ while bombs in Beirut.
"chipmunk on the deck \ terrified, can’t find its way \ this I understand."
stepping stones vanish \ the garden makes final moves \ I accept what is
sunflowers rising \ poke their heads above the fence \ they see fall coming.
compassion working \ it is me who makes it real \ Buddha meaningless.
burnt tree trunks \ stop stretching skyward \ start standing still
broken umbrellas \ young women's hats-flattened \ cormorant weather
city spruce cones \ cocooned in spring ice \ fall unopened
First brown bat of spring \ barks through the blue dusk. Crane flies? \ Bring me the Sphinx Moths!
"May dusk, black outlines \ of  bare tamaracks-broken \ under winter's cloak."
April evenings \ still air-mosquitoes slumber \ unfolding
unseen geese call \ to each other-to the flags \ snapping below
"dead bird under window \ maybe found its clearer, brighter place \ after all"
corner store: \ spider's built a web \ across the butterfly nets
vacant lot: \ streetlights shine up at me \ from a broken mirror
I love the colors trees turn \ but not yet
"boy in dentist chair screams \ Mom stands in waiting room, \ hands over her mouth"
some idiot with a campfire up in the trees \ but the smoke smells good \ like a hundred childhood mornings
leaning on the window \ rainclouds read over my shoulder
"mail delivery— \ today, the sound of the dog \ not barking"
"crescent moon— \ still, I turn my gaze back \ to the muddied path"
splash! \ ripples stir \ the moon's reflection
wine glasses touch— \ the top button of her blouse \ not yet undone
campfire talk \ moths flutter in and out \ of the shadows
where only yesterday \ I heard the owl's mating call \ golden leaves
meditation class— \ for the first time he contemplates \ his own navel
pinholes for sleep \ stretched across \ a dirty sheet
"good night, fair city \ your belly button sex drive \ makes me fucking sick"
across plains we flew \ in memoriam of you \ love's labours anew
"summer, \ on the beach \ and pablo neruda"
a 12 year old bomb \ makes his way into market \ both are made fools
boz scaggs: \ good singer \ bad fashion
baroness undresses \ flashes her boobs \ hounds wail in the rain
a garden of weeds \ fed by dry heat and neglect \ is still a garden
trying to tune in \ a song of the soul but my \ reception is bad
bill's eyes blue-bird blue \ his sweet old leaky raincoat \ yellow-cab yellow
pennies on your eyes \ last of the big-time spenders \ i guess we'll miss you
"the streets are filled with \ lonely people and litter \ sure, just toss me there"
my hair looks greyer \ in the autumn morning light \ mirrors can be cruel
there is no escape \ the stars are moving closer \ might as well get drunk
she is temptation \ this dark-haired lurking beauty.  \ I would miss this ache.
"not willing to leave \ this imperfect nest, this bird \ has so much to learn."
this summer garden \ a convoluted chaos. \ simplicity mislaid.
this lobelia \ pink purple blue orgasm \ --need a cigarette.
"her black kimono \ opens, reveals just enough. \ it’s never enough."
out of the sweatlodge \ into the cool mountain night. \ humbled by starlight.
parents’ ugly spat.  \ will she remember this fight \ when she’s eleven?
"erotic tingling \ married Japanese woman \ cleans my teeth, gently"
starlings gossip \ amused at our lovemaking \ the quivering limbs
Desperate over you \ when you stand off-over eggs. \ Over nothing.
Sunset-a wing \ of urine-soaked \ swan feathers.
What was I doing? \ Collecting ephemera? \ For what?
"No poems in a month. \ Every metaphor, sixth rate. \ Too many lost words, maybe."
"That stained journal, \ abandoned. How like mourning \ her black ink."
sidewalk roses: windows \ into more fragrant and colorful worlds
sleep-colored \ tires on asphalt
"no awning, \ only an umbrella \ for the flower vendor"
more rain: \ the cat shreds another \ paper bag

lakeside tai chi \ I wave hands as clouds while \ the phoebe catches flies
the rhythmic tapping \ of my hiking stick- \ a thrush sings melody
river valley walk- \ a single leaf floating \ on turbulent waters
only one thing beats \ watching diane dance: her red \ boots under my bed
water into wine \ every time you look at me \ my girl parts get drunk
funny you still want \ all this time alone with me \ (these words are all wrong)
"ten years sober 'till \ ""who the hell invited you?"" \ ... more tequila please"
hard to say sorry \ when you don't know what you did; \ that was so awful
callie's back in town \ that means lagers and flirting \ at the irish pub
"grandfather's cologne: \ pipe tobacco, peppermints \ and ivory soap"
won't you meet \ my hound dog: \ temperance
"midnight: \ bats are diving \ ""it's hot,"" she says"
delicate toes \ behind sandal straps \ winking an invitation
guitar concert \ three thousand people \ strumming and believing

radio hockey game \ journey to mountains by car  \ perfect word pictures
"I watch green return \ this bathroom window check, a \ shower ritual"
"there is nothing wrong \ with me, nothing wrong with me, \ nothing wrong, is there?"
May comes dismal and sad  \ the lawn is white this morning \ chickadees confused
Who wanders the valley \ this late at night? Just us \ matching footsteps.
"Spring football players \ pop and hustle, grunting. \ Yearless.  Fatter."
"The Japanese man \ who picks the dumpster bottles. \ Early, this morning."
"Street priest's heel gashed wide \ on broken windows, limping \ late for the graveyard."
Bellhops gibber \ watch smoking vagrants \ jealous-like.

One-eyed stumbler killed \ while fishing off the bus curb \ for cigarette butts.
"leaf in the morning \ lying on damp soil, holding \ dewdrops for the ants"
a thousand lonely writers \ - the bookstore is empty
the air is heavy with spruce and humidity \ and your airplane flying away

"I walk and a robin flies \ behind a restaurant, \ through the soft greasy air"
cranes over lakeshore: \ each takes its own reflection \ away from the waves
