balmy breeze \ swarming bees circle \ the river bank
whitecaps on the bay \ the overhead cries \ of migrating birds
deep \ within \ the \ lettuce \ a \ slug \ shaped \ hole
siskins' trill \ sunlight floods \ the bare larch
drifting fog \ an acquaintance \ i'd rather not meet
ferry harbour customs area swifts dart through the heat
frost lingers \ i clean brussels sprouts \ in the kitchen sink
boat house \ the graying planks \ one with the cliff
the small cabin \ one room \ and a sauna
summer's day \ a dad shows his son \ grandpa's work
on the jetty \ above the fish \ my feet
soft breeze \ the gentle hum \ of a beehive
spring morning \ in the hands of the child \ daffodils
insomnia \ in my waterglass \ moonbeams
spring dusk \ more and more stars \ on wet branches
dance studio \ a crack in the mirror glued \ with paper hearts
my ear conch \ to your ear conch \ sounds of the sea
sunny noon \ a wheel-less scooter \ at the pub door
housewarming \ a kitten chases \ his own tail
I draw the snow \ said the child \ with an empty sheet
winter zoo \ a rat walks in \ the monkeys cage
leaving home \ a curve carved off \ the moon
stepping into \ the same snowpath \ year of the monkey
another glass of champagne \ remembering what i choose \ to remember
cluster of juncos \ in the apricot tree \ silent snow
twist of dust \ across the plaza \ going home
dry leaves \ in a snow pocket \ blind faith
midwinter a red amaryllis lights the fire
