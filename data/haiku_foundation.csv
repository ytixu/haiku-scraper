"Outside the clinic \ a crow, slow, stepping away \ from some carrion."
Autumnal evening. \ The shadows following me \ are getting longer.
A breath of wind. \ Leaves of grass bending \ and trembling back.
"November drizzle. \ In my headlights, vanishing, \ two graceful deer."
A child in the door \ watching the old man walk by \ in the autumn rain.
At the river bend \ an old man's taking a rest. \ Fall evening sunshine.

country graveyard \ the oldest stones \ under tall pines
night snow \ my father's handwriting \ on the ornament box
old frog \ up to his ears \ in moonlight
a sky full of stars \ how improbable \ my parents would meet
all around \ light failing in a field \ of fireflies
find me in the sounds \ of sparkling brooks ... young leaves \ songs of forest birds
fields of snow \ not only moonlight \ but the moon
two crows \ surprised \ I speak their language
"Tell me magic moth \ from a groping sleeping thing, \ what could I become"
"of starlight, Ardi \ the mystic garden \ before there were gods"
my haplogroup \ shows the spongegene \ distant lightning
Firefly garden . . . \ rising up \ to fill the sky
"For a little while, \ our shadows on the shoji \ as the candles flame"
silent Friends meeting . . . \ the sound of chairs being moved \ to enlarge the circle
Behind lace curtains \ tiger lilies in a vase \ unfurled in the sun
Beach cottage bedroom . . . \ waiting for the beam of light \ to sweep the room again
in the summer heat \ the jar of freight cars bumping \ down and up the line
Among the great stones \ set to defend the castle . . . \ young ferns find
for the fragrance \ brushing tomato leaves \ warm August sun
Wakened by birdsong \ drifting from one world of dreams \ into another
In the far corner \ at the bottom of the grave . . . \ pair of digger's footprints
Sometimes I think . . . \ you would answer the phone \ if I were to call
home from errands \ a hero's welcome \ from the dog
what remains \ of the mountain \ sand between my toes
cowlick \ some part of me \ still wild
cold winter rain \ the swollen creek also \ rushing home
for better or for worse \ our lights and darks \ tumbling together
frigid night \ the bowl of soup \ becomes my universe
"neither the rosebush \ nor blue sky cheer me today, \ but the bird's song..."
sunrise songs \ birds drinking \ the light
clock sprung ahead \ lunch tastes \ the same
months after the blossoms \ i remember to notice \ the cherry tree
rain doesn't stop \ the cardinal from April \ singing
warm spring \ playing with the door \ the cat and the wind
bougainvillea in bloom \ nothing moves in the afternoon \ of tenuous quietude
perfumed street \ the flowers of cinamomos \ are not to be seen
afternoon in the backyard \ recollections of childhood \ in this watery pear
"the long lasting day \ darkens finally \ ah, crescent moon"
Children's Day \ in these pictures of my son \ how happy I was
packing up to leave \ everything we have \ dead weight
before the rain \ the sound \ of bluebells
winter solstice \ commuters stand still \ on the escalators
home town \ in the familiar houses \ strangers
bus stop \ the old man \ never gets on
floating downstream - \ the burden of my shadow \ on a mayfly
incoming tide ... \ the writing fills \ both sides
still pond-- \ shadow of a mayfly \ in the depths
summer glare \ along the beach \ only light
crashing waves - \ almost believing \ it's forever
cold morning ... \ reality drifts back \ as a dream
first light ... \ out of the shadows \ a deer
sleepless moon ... \ dawn spills over \ the wasteland
distant thunder - \ the writer of this haiku \ ... dead

stock market \ spiraling down . . . \ this cherry petal
a crow shadow \ intersects with mine \ Indian summer
jay \ so blue \ in the green
unmarked infant graves \ a sudden release \ of cherry petals
not until flight \ the lavender-blue \ of this small butterfly
cat on the fence \ his tail \ strung to the moon
it starts to snow - \ the blind musician \ looks upwards
two black dogs run and play - \ their red tongues \ their white bones

rustle of bamboo \ the steady pace \ of oxen hauling fruit
my friend's wake \ a bookshelf labeled \ To Be Read
grass on the graves \ the whippoorwill \ far away
cloudless day \ a wheat field rippling \ in the wind
wings of a crow \ gather sunlight \ between the trees
in the woods \ through the rusting can \ a grapevine
sultry afternoon \ buffalo grass tickles \ the dog's belly
the bamboo \ windblown shadows \ across a pond

in front of a house \ leafless fig tree dressed by \ a flock of magpies
A hot barrel \ of antiaircraft gun. \ Spring rain evaporating.
Along the road \ wild poppies \ penetrated a cornfield.
Daybreak \ in the muddy trench \ a helmet full of water.
Nobody is picking \ all those ripe cherries \ in front of grandpa's house.

In the summer storm \ the mowed grass \ trembles with its scent
Gusts of spring wind \ the tender echo of a church bell \ in the distance
Her hands bless \ the indoors flowers even \ with drops of water
Bonsai display \ a small table \ full of verses
"Young gulls \ clashing for a bit of crumbs \ with their shadows, too"
a bombed roof \ patched with a piece \ of starry sky
moonlight \ tiny waves sway thick walls \ of the castle
whistling \ the wind turns a snowy \ merry-go-round
a castle on the shore. \ around centennial walls \ sliding carps
around the mulberry tree \ a boy catching chickens \ with purple legs
under the eaves \ on the harp made of ice \ muses the Sun
sudden rain \ the toddler's hands reach \ for the sky
blues song \ picking the way \ into cottonfields
almost ashore \ the ga-ga-ga \ of two ducks
summer dusk \ as still as the algaed pond \ a dead frog

lily's aroma \ finds a way into the street \ Lily's aroma
thunder loudly roars \ deafening noise splits the ears \ buzzing buzzing bees
two black clouds dancing \ raindrops quenching the soil's thirst \ a bra drying up
summer fruits abound \ two bunches of grapes protrude \ her sassy earrings
Nimble winter rain \ reconfiguring the soil \ A Photoshop craft
