sundawn \ a flutter of mourning doves, \ & poised, light-bathed, one faun
mapletree buds, \ their small shadows \ in water-glazed mud
white lilac \ fragrantly exuberant \ beside the porchdeck
putting down a book \ to listen to the god \ in the half-cleared brook
high noon \ straight-up trunks of poplars shadowless \ a foreshadowing ... soon, soon?
watching a program \ on Brazil's rain forests, \ anger poisons calm
on the grass \ two pitched-from-a-car beer cans. \ unthinking ass!
a cardinal's song \ blends with the brilliant sunset. \ surely, nothing's wrong?
cicadas at dusk - \ seventeen years hence, shall we see \ substance or husk?
in moonlight \ swish of owl wings, this heartstab: \ glitter can gloss blight
First spring day \ melting and melting and melting \ tracks of the mountain man.
Green a-glitter \ fluttering in the sun: \ the wind shines
a butterfly's shadow \ crosses the artist's \ blank canvas
the spare lines \ of a wishbone \ on the mauve plate
shovelfuls of stinking earth \ bring a whiff \ of incense
so bright the night of seventh moon \ gathering strawberries \ cool and sweet
odor of tea \ rises in steam \ from the dragon pot
in the stillness \ the river \ drips from her paddle
for a little time \ the dial tone \ after you've gone
beyond our silence \ a train whistle \ into the distance
sharp memories \ return an old fear \ the glare of sun on glass
on the rock \ net cast again \ deep brine waters
shore flowers \ without \ petals
surfeited \ with tortellini: \ rain outside
out all night, \ the cat curls up \ in the closet's darkness
plasticine worms: \ their colors gone \ into sunset's burn
her scarlet skirt \ flaring \ to the fiddler's tune
afterimage \ of jane darwell's eyes \ on california
a fly lands \ on the mirror \ . . . goes off again
in the ochre vase \ seven lilies opened yesterday \ three today
the tabernacle. \ doors thrown \ wide
Jesus Christ among guards \ the garden caught \ in shadows of the moon
checking locks \ as the rain \ begins
wet earth, \ the smell of it \ again she turns in her sleep
a purple dawn \ last of the butter beans \ fill their pods
wintered reeds \ rattle words \ that pierce
egret in flight \ onion skin pages \ turn over in the wind
"it's nothing but an act" \ she shouts \ the dogwood turning red
in a drunken torpor \ dream of stubborn \ love
she wakes \ to apple scent and reeling \ maple leaves
jobless, \ letting the dog run off \ in the moonless night
beyond \ greener pastures \ . . . that never were
scatterflies on the window - \ the silence of bloodroot \ beneath the leaves
my own name \ last \ in the family Bible
another year ends \ snow dusted \ on the foothills
wind \ where the pines \ and blackness meet
occasional shots \ of Jack Daniels: \ Chattanooga
no longer \ idyllic; \ few places are
votive lights \ shivering -all those earthquake \ Armenian dead
seeding the compost pile \ with earthworms \ again
dark place \ where square grows round \ and words glow bright
shaping \ the poem \ slowly
planetarium music . . . \ the blind boy's fingers \ land on the moon
coming up the coast \ the cry of snowgeese \ darkened by snow
as if the tide \ broke free \ of the shore
under the peak, \ cold fog blows \ against petrified reeds
uptrail, \ bristlecone \ looming and rimy
pale stars \ flickering over \ our snow angels
along the road \ to mother's \ summer grasses
out of season \ amaryllis bloom \ blood red
rustle of bracken \ cloud hidden moon \ reappears
the mime's hat \ a little hole \ large enough for crickets
silvery fog \ moves in across the shore \ up the cliff
the fire leaps - \ my grandson's first Christmas Eve \ laughter
lights out \ all the stockings \ stuffed with starlight
so late, and on the pond \ someone skating - \ a gleam, a scrape
centered \ by north light \ the potter's wheel
small dreams \ curve \ within her hands
spectrums of color \ volley back into themselves \ paperweigh
walking home at dawn \ a witch \ with a shoe in each hand
groan \ and thunder of the stream at flood \ remote as childhood
a kingfisher \ diving into \ the moon
a plover circles - \ just beyond the sawgrass \ there are graves
I miss \ the flash of her \ white teeth
between darkness \ and light \ the flutter of a moth
Hike up the mountain . . . \ the book about God \ weighs me down.
after heavy rain \ the moon appears, bright, \ over the marsh
all the dreams linger, \ unfaded, \ still
night storm - \ a deeper dark unrolls \ across the prairie
removing her wedding ring \ she brushes Â¡t along \ her husband's name
son of an MIA \ the flag pin on his lapel \ upside-down
woman touches a name \ while looking at \ an old photo
elderly couple \ their faces reflected \ over their son's name
man in a filthy army jacket \ tries to scratch on \ his name
a candle \ left burning on the ground \ its flame almost out
anzio beach . . . \ another wave gathers \ and breaks
How many \ dew drops make up \ these walls?
On razor wire \ squats a crow - \ winter night
Black-uniformed winter fly \ greeting me \ behind bullet-proof glass
Old guard escorting me \ coughing like bullfrog \ cigarette smoke for breath
Prison cat in shadows \ stalking the shaft \ of searchlight
Capturing \ snowflake fireflies \ with my tongue
Beating time with nightstick, \ cricket sound \ while I urinate
Oh, winter moon, \ what have you done now \ keep-locked with the mountains?
A thousand temple bells - \ the noise \ of the cell block
Decorating my cell again \ I notice roommate - \ a silverfish on my pillow
From out of Henderson's Haiku, \ my old wife's photograph: \ cells doors automatically locking.
soothing rain: \ the mown meadow releases \ pungence of mint
Butterfly shadows . . . \ not finding \ the butterfly
abandoned farmhouse: \ bird nest in the mail box \ also deserted
abandoned farmhouse: \ wallpaper peeling back to \ my childhood
abandoned farmhouse: \ something scratching \ inside the furnace
abandoned farmhouse: \ the quiet bedroom where I \ feared the dark
abandoned farmhouse: a \ yellowed grocery list taped \ to the counter top
abandoned farmhouse: a \ moth flies out of the water \ faucet
abandoned farmhouse: \ my daughter \ snaps pictures of our visit
Into old pots and pans \ thrown out in the backyard - \ the musical rain
here & there \ in bare treetops \ mistletoe
in a shabby motel \ all night \ treefrogs in rain
cottonmouths \ in the swamp ... \ a house on stilts
family get-together \ all the eyes all the feelers \ all the hands tearing shrimp
morning in the French Quarter \ cafÃ© au lait & \ beignets with sparrows
the river wind blows \ into the Quarter \ & through his saxophone
on the riverfront \ a stranger \ takes my smile
the breeze \ off the Mississippi \ fills my skirt
behind grillwork \ down darkness to sun \ in a hidden courtyard
cool the alley \ through the grillwork swirls \ cat pee smell
in the morning shops \ half the doorways \ fill with shade
all the Mardi Gras colors \ in the masks \ in the houses
on the iron lace balconies \ only flowers \ sunning
from the suite dusk \ fills in the river \ & all the tiny lights are slow
huge limbs of the live oak \ their reaching out \ over the young grass
in a pecan grove \ wandering spring shadows \ cows & blackbirds
parked on the runway \ its wings drooped \ the winter sun
the slow day ... \ in the empty motel corridor \ a stack of dirty dishes
sundown in the empty bar \ the player-piano keys \ begin
the big waitress departs \ the china teapot \ shakes
January sun ... \ the cotton fields \ dotted with leftovers
longest night - \ his forehead burning \ into my hand
gone from the wood \ the bird I knew \ by song alone
Flashes of sunset \ between the cars \ the eastbound freight
old railroad tracks \ bobbing sunflowers surround \ the turquoise outhouse
violet aster \ still bright \ behind me
in blue-black ocean night \ the ferry's churning white wake \ fades in the distance
after her phonecall \ following wet footprints \ back to the bath
hikers at dusk \ spilling with shadows \ out the canyon mouth
high country \ feeling the forest \ hidden in the dark
sleeping in his bed \ -a dream \ of her grandson's return
Honolulu airport \ breathing wet warm air \ sniffs of unknown flowers
wrestling on the edge \ of the State Fisheries tank \ -two soaked monkeys
sunrise didj at Ulsoor Lake \ dobi-wallahs slap \ their morning loads on stone
mountain hotspring \ snowflakes sink in \ the rising steam
waking my daughter \ frost-flowers on the window \ from her breath
driving to meet our son \ -nighthawks fly \ before the storm cloud
past the plane's great wing \ a strip of thin grass shimmers \ in the jet wind
wet pavement \ the smell of sage \ all the way home
on Lookout Rock \ one step \ to the red hawk
A red shaft of light \ dances on your moist eyelids: \ the searing morning.
Frog Mountain rises \ to arch its back in the clouds: \ unforeseen downpour.
Three men and three birds \ stand still in the forest, all \ surprised by rain.
Rain like the Deluge: \ a mudspattered Apache \ sings in Cibecue.
The day hides itself \ within a grove of aspen. \ Thunder pursues it.
Uprooted clouds: \ Summer holds the pale mountains, \ calls down the clear night.
cajun cabin . . . \ the aroma of hot gumbo \ floats on the bayou
Gunshot! \ The tide of gulls breaks \ like a scattering wave
Gathering silence \ in my mind is \ the hardest thing to do
Against the wind's chill \ I button my sweater \ feet dug in sand
The sun slips low \ a carnelian red paving \ the water with dark light
How many wanderers \ have followed the sun \ down?
(The girl with the soul \ of a gull \ never came back)
Questions \ purl like schools of fish \ in dangerous waters
Questions \ without breath without answers \ a broken shell
on the cardboard box \ holding the frozen wino: \ Fragile: Do Not Crush
From the fire escape \ the cry of the mourning dove \ wintering over
New condominium \ its exhaust grate claimed by \ a new derelict
Wind chill minus five \ the piercing whistles \ of the starlings
The young mother \ stoops to warm the child's mittens \ between her gloves
Between lace curtains \ the white cat's eyes \ follow a snowflake
A crow flies down \ to land in the new snow \ its voice ringing
Madison Avenue \ a row of ginkgoes mulched \ with old Xmas trees
Suet on a string \ suspended from a snowy branch \ three sparrows make it spin
In the shadow of \ office buildings, bagpiper's \ Amazing Grace
Last night's fading dream . . . \ On the blue teapot birds drift \ beyond the willows

Against his coat \ I brush my lips - \ the silence of snowflakes
away from eyes \ the stairwell holds \ us in its arms

still \ childless: \ milkweed
