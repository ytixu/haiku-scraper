after every rain \ reveals a rainbow ready \ to make someone smile
together we fly \ and travel around the world \ just the two of us
the river hushing \ and all the birds' chirping fades - \ the sun bids farewell
focus on the good, \ positive, and all things bright \ and ignore sadness
I'm sitting somewhere \ alone and feeling peaceful \ watching clouds above
night sky and moonlight \ white sheets, warm hugs, promises - \ oh boy, i miss you
breakfast in bed with \ roses and a note saying \ “morning, beautiful”
the sun is shining \ bright and yellow perfect for \ morning talks and jogs
green tea and biscuits \ people chatting and laughing \ on Tuesday morning
wanting to know you \ even more under the sun \ hopes, dreams, and the like
murmurs and secrets \ and your kisses on my cheek - \ I feel so special
my lipstick stains on \ your forehead as I hope for \ this day to not end
