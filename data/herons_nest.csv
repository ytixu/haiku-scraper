summer afternoon \ the saxophone busker \ takes a drag
tornado watch \ cricket songs carried \ from tall grass
Gypsy violin . . . \ the wheat harvest \ sparkling with fireflies
mountain pass wind \ whistles through my pack frame \ a pika answers
crescent moon \ quiet lullaby \ from the rocker
my housefly s autumn \ the window with the hills \ of apple trees
moonlit waves \ the glow of streetlights \ on clapboard cottages
snow in the forecast \ some extra spice \ in the Jambalya
12.01 am \ flying a drunkard s path \ the year s first moth
snow erasing \ the garden s features \ teaching my dad to shave
unilingual \ I study the expressions \ in a wren s eye
first cold day \ the cat kneads \ a patch of sunlight
first flakes \ discovering my childhood \ in a box
Orion s belt \ my words byte by byte \ to another continent
after the funeral \ snow covers \ the dark places
a grain of rice \ on the mayor s face . . . \ New Year s Levee
winter chill \ turkey vultures circling \ one of their own
long train \ the roundness of snow \ on tanker cars
winter tulips \ squeaking \ as they enter the vase
rabbits at dusk \ as if foxes did not also \ love twilight
January \ the gym crowded \ with resolutions
forecasted storm . . . \ the low-battery \ in my kindle
hunger moon \ the sound of squirrel teeth \ on a hazelnut
winter mist \ at the stoplight pink sneakers \ keep running
lent is over \ a bartender flips \ the coaster
pond shimmer \ there not there \ grebes
early spring \ the honey pot \ nearly empty
goose crossing \ the old pick-up s \ broken horn
valley stillness \ a butterfly passes through \ an empty log
fading stars \ a hedgehog haphazards \ its way back home
filtered sunlight \ where the forest thins \ daffodils
her gray hair \ gone blonde \ first day of spring
fiddlehead fern \ the way it rolls \ off the tongue
sunset \ flash of starlings \ in the acacia
day lilies \ waking to find \ it wasn t a dream
