Purple loosestrife 
A cold morning \ the pink of tulips \ through the mist. 
Harvest moon \ dancing with my husband \ in the living room 
a movement of deer \ into twilight \ suddenly spring 
fireflies competing \ with a full moon \ summer solstice 
the way grass parts \ as the pheasant passes \ spring's end 
moonlessness-- \ so many ways \ I want to touch you 
earth day-- \ even the shadows at dusk \ smell green 
fading \ right before my eyes \ morning moon 
light rain 
winter rain \ the confusion in her voice \ all over again 
This morning the geese \ have taken over the skies \ in wild abandon \ how sudden this stillness then \ and now how I have missed you 
morning moon \ filling up my window \ autumn's end 
autumn twilight \ captures the mood of leaves \ swirling everywhere \ in this circular motion \ hear the laughter of children 
white cloud of a moon \ drifting in the morning sky \ these October days \ how like a fine mist that fades \ this future now so fragile 
summer's end \ the tenderness \ of light 
after loving-making \ scent of wild clover \ through the window 
my children and I \ race to see the sunset \ before it fades \ how tenuous time now seems \ slipping away from my reach 
after the dream \ the scent of approaching rain \ in the dusty air 
park bench \ she puts acorns \ in his ears

spring trek

a moth flutters \ over the candle flame . . . \ damned idiot 
still water . . . \ the undercurrent \ in her voice 
November winds \ the dog finds dead birds \ in the hedge 
desert cemetery- \ my sister in law \ does not weep 
summer ends- \ her freckles pale \ in dark tan 
highway fog- \ the honking of geese \ homeward bound 
desert wind- \ iron and copper flavor \ in my coffee

nearly rain 
slow steady rain \ the muscles in my back \ unknot 
evening breeze \ my neighbor s bbq \ drifts this way 
high winds \ a zillion elm seeds \ looking for love

autumn chill \ replacing the battery \ in my mouse 
after the rainstorm \ last drops from the roof \ heighten the silence 
at the top of the fence 
thunderstorm 
summer night love \ whatever the neighbors \ are cooking 
storm watch 
headlights \ in the dust storm \ old friends 
winter night \ without the heat \ of his company 
all the typos \ in her apology \ spring winds 
as the world burns zazen 
leaving home 
beneath dry leaves something to believe in 
day settles down \ to this world of dust \ evening zazen 
seeing where 
a long winter \ bevel on the mirror \ throws a rainbow 
a dog s bark \ wavers in the wind \ evening shadows 
another year \ those crossed out names \ in my address book 
my neighbor s \ apricot tree is blooming \ secondhand love 
overcast \ the first blooms \ of apricot 
homesick \ sundown just behind \ the fence 
spitting seeds \ into a blue sky \ the old elm 
forgetting to ask \ for the seniors' rate- \ falling leaves 
just over the fence \ a constellation of stars \ and trucks 
wildflowers \ along my neighbor's wall \ soften her voice 
unexpected guest- \ a thought came out \ of nowhere 
industrial skyline-- \ where the rain \ makes rust 
sharing stories-- 
after midnight-- \ crickets \ and a city train 
stars in the river-- \ two boys \ night fishing 
sun on a dragonfly's wings-- \ when all else \ vanishes 
cloud cover-- \ just knowing \ the moon is still there 
mandarin-- \ a few segments \ of sun 
whale sighting-- \ all the smart phones \ lined up on the deck 
freight train night-- 
cold night-- \ not one silver track \ on the footpath 
lullabies \ of suburban \ night trains 
winter greys-- \ seabirds string \ between pier lights 
steady drizzle-- \ a rainbow fades \ into the grey 
above the oil refinery \ moon sails \ seaward 
dark early-- \ sepia roses \ under street lights 
night rain-- \ never too old \ for a lullaby 
rainy afternoon-- \ hot pikelets \ with butter and honey 
rearview mirror-- \ pelicans with sunrise \ on their wings 
city peak hour - 
industrial decay-- \ the dripping rust \ in heavy rain 
night rain-- \ we jump in neon puddles \ and breathe rosemary 
freight train-- \ the night runs out \ of breath 
nighttime whoosh -- 
car park puddle-- \ i walk through \ the sky 
around the campfire \ we wait \ for the milky way 
graffiti night-- \ all these stars \ sprayed everywhere 
city bound train-- \ a book and a suitcase \ full of stars 
autumn chill-- \ one little cricket \ sings to the moon 
cooler mornings-- \ the honey slows down \ from the spoon 
wild beaches \ in winter time-- \ take me there 
home alone-- \ sound of my fork \ on the pasta bowl 
alongside the train tracks-- \ secrets of orchids \ under moonlight 
stormy weather -- \ a clarinet \ blues afternoon 
trains approaching-- \ someone on a platform \ reading to the moon 
smell of rain \ young deer run \ across the field 
white clouds \ glide safely \ over mine fields 
winter solstice -- \ the Persian cat's half- \ closed eyes 
beneath the fireworks \ endless bullfrogs 
among new lilies she waters the stone Buddha 
all I need are mountains \ and a hedgehog - \ autumn deepens 
this winter's day the garbage cans evanesce 
To the Finland Station -- \ they rush \ to strike a deal for iPhones 
the metallic tang of deer's blood \ dominates the forest 
cat's paws crawling \ across a lake's surface \ morning silence 
Croton hedges \ with their faux fall foliage \ South Florida in autumn 
blood on barbed wire \ a pale moon \ reveals the crime \ sang sur le barbel 
Red fall foliage \ the Sun at noon \ glorious 
They share \ a bruised apple \ moonlit feast for two 
Harvest moon -- \ too much light \ for field mice 
summer rains gone \ the river \ finds its own channel 
his name \ on the black granite wall \ and we must ask why 
hellebore bloom that spring morning as tanks rumble 
rumble of thunder \ rouses dawn \ late summer in Miami 
ash covers his school desk \ all the remains \ 8 17 am -- Hiroshima local time 
brush in hand \ he carefully... \ 8 16 local time Hiroshima 
in a pile of rubble \ faint peeps are heard \ rats of course 
ebb tide's retreat 
tang of salt spray \ at a fishing pier \ late summer 
lighting the way \ with a jar of fireflies \ childhood's last summer 
in the evening coolness \ of a verandah \ hereyes reflect stars 
after a long night \ the singing of birds \ at dawn 
Gazing at the moon \ on a still summer's evening \ feast for mosquitoes 
Clouds gather \ in a darkening sky \ a walk interrupted 
a careful sip \ more of chickpea than coffee \ his breakfast brew 
croaking of frogs \ just after dawn \ summer memories 
silk from a web \ entangled in my hair \ a homeless spider 
Before dawn \ By the small pond \ The sound of crickets 
chamomile petals \ swimming in rainwater \ for her blonde highlights 
Splat \ a windshield and a bug \ find each other 
polished granite \ reflects my face off \ my father's grave 
cold rain \ sharp as nails \ late afternoon 
El Hueso's dry bones 
old brittle dry bones 
childhood's summer gift \ that first dandelion \ dancing on the wind 
My tea gets colder \ and the madeleine just sinks \ memory betrays 
a cooing is heard \ from a small puff of feathers \ another dawn 
small green waves crashing \ against a porcelain rim \ morning tea tempest 
in an old snapshot 
faces from the past \ their memories in old photos \ effaced by the flood 
red poppies growing \ between rows of white tombstones \ as in remembrance 
under a full moon \ a homeless man gathers cans \ urban harvest 
deep into the night \ a dog's sharp bark \ becomes gunfire 
butterfly wings \ so loud their flapping \ in a temple's silence 
sharp smell \ after a noon downpour \ electric summer 
rows of white markers \ all at attention \ Memorial Day 
late morning breakfast \ left uneaten \ too much of spring 
Just a small basket \ filled with hidden treasures \ she carries proudly 
a yellowed clipping \ falls out from her Bible \ Emmett Till's obit 
In front of bronze doors \ they huddle against the cold \ the newly homeless 
early morning dew \ on a bronze temple bell \ just before ringing 
clear lake enclosed \ entirely within \ a bowl of miso 
breakfast still rumbles \ but no other guns are heard \ Armistice morning. 
he winds up his watch \ so carefully that morning \ that will end the war 
The bugler plays Tap \ her face so serious \ her parents so proud 
Ordinary morning 
mid morning coffee 
Rainbows reflected \ in so many potholes \ afternoon rainstorm 
that spring day \ the flowers have long faded \ yet we remember 
the mirror reflects \ a face I know so well \ dad's 
a flagpole stands guard \ before a flooded schoolhouse \ as a river runs 
perched on a guardrail \ of a busy highway \ an egret preens 
Cracks on a sidewalk \ lost among the grass and weeds \ urban spring 
Cracked head statue \ of the Buddha a reminder \ everything passes. 
one plus one 3 \ a happy couple expecting \ their first child 
Fountain pen ink spill \ not contained by a blotter \ Mare Crisium 
she cries silently \ her sobs barely audible \ and no one to hear 
rivulets of red \ running down her pale young face \ she clutches a doll 
he turns one last time 
the War on Horror--- \ G.I.'s on hashish kill \ Afghans for sport 
I turn off the pumpkin lights--- \ a predawn \ harvest moon 
white roadside crosses \ where the road's swale meets Nature \ memento mori 
harvest moon gleaners \ pale faces leaden eyes stare \ at an empty field 
glassy-eyed gutted \ catch of the day on shaved ice \ at the fish market 
neither white nor black \ a yellow smog that won't lift \ Alzheimer's pall 
Full Corn Moon \ time to gather the harvest \ before leaves fall 
charred goat bones \ they say -- without conviction \ Somali nightmares 
too hot for miso \ he pushes it aside \ that August morning 
wildflower bouquet \ left on a country highway \ the endless road 
tea leaves carefully \ saved dried and used again \ hidden poverty 
there's a pelican \ -- in that ball of feathers tar \ or it is a gull 
mountain hike \ lost among butterflies and \ the scent of honey 
closed window \ a bee lies so stillamong \ faded pollen 
twin bed \ wearing your flannel shirt \ keeps me warm 
back porch \ laughter echoes \ between claps of thunder 
end of summer \ strands of an abandoned kite \ flutter in the wind 
in the hospice \ an out of tune piano helps \ her sing without words 
hand in hand \ white petals blossom \ as we pass 
abandoned home \ an old life laid to rest \ among weeds and trees 
humid morning \ the scent of lilacs \ fills each breath 
icy pavement 
Rain on a flat tin roof. Hammers without nails
