the whole family \ all with white hair and canes \ visiting graves
souls' festival \ today also there is smoke \ from the crematory
lotus pond \ as they are unplucked \ Souls' Festival
Buddha's Death Day \ from wrinkled praying hands \ the rosaries' sound
Mii Temple \ knocking on the gate for a wish \ today's moon
not to think of yourself \ as someone who did not count -- \ Festival of the Souls
the moon so pure \ a wandering monk carries it \ across the sand
all night \ autumn winds being heard \ behind the mountains
blue seas \ breaking waves smell of rice wine \ tonight's moon
so clear the sound \ echoes to the Big Dipper \ the fulling block
hair shaved in a moon-shape \ with their hands on their knees \ in the early hours of night
the setting moon \ the thing that remains \ four corners of his desk
sleeping in the temple \ the serious-looking face \ is moon-viewing
the full moon \ seven story-songs of a woman \ turning towards the sea
viewing the moon \ no one at the party \ has such a beautiful face
the farmer's child \ rests from husking rice \ then sees the moon
occasional clouds \ one gets a rest \ from moon-viewing
famous moon! \ circling the pond all night \ even to the end
buying a measure box \ now I feel differently \ about moon-viewing
harvest moon \ northland weather \ uncertain skies
taken in my hand \ it will vanish in hot tears \ autumn frost
full autumn moon \ to my gate comes rising \ crested tide
thin from the Kiso trip \ and still not yet recovered \ the late harvest moon
bright red \ the pitiless sun \ autumn winds
autumn wind \ broken with sadness \ his mulberry stick
autumn winds \ in the sliding door's opening \ a sharp voice
autumn wind: \ as thickets in fields are \ Fuwa's barriers
people no longer live at the Fuwa Barrier \ in a house with wooden eaves \ weathered bones
just thinking of the wind \ it pierces my body \ shaking the grave
my weeping voice \ autumn wind \ for one touched by monkey cries
how is it when a child's abandoned \ in autumn winds \ speaking out
my lips are cold \ in autumn wind \ autumn wind
in Ise's shrine cemetery \ even more lonely \ the moon still is
though it seems far from home \ Suma in summer \ walking on and on
even through I fall down sick \ in fields of clover \ from this very day
erase \ the inscription with dew \ on the bamboo hat
where's the moon? \ as the temple bell is -- \ sunk in the sea
autumn colors \ without a pot \ of red-brown soup
turn this way! \ I too feel lonely \ late in autumn
I go \ and you remain \ two autumns
in the world outside \ is it harvesting time? \ the grass of my hut
borrowing sleep \ from the scarecrow's sleeves \ midnight frost
along this road \ going with no one \ autumn evening
autumn deepens \ the man next door \ how is he doing?
saying farewell to people \ farewell being said to me brings \ autumn in Kiso
"I'm tired of kids." \ for the person who says this \ there are no flowers
I didn't die! \ the end of of a journey \ is autumn nightfall
autumn nears \ my heart is drawn \ to a four-mat room
autumn night \ striking and making it crumble \ our small talk
blowing stones \ flying from the volcano Asama \ autumn gale
Stone Mountain \ whiter than the stones \ autumn wind
rainy day \ the world's autumn closes \ Boundary Town
bagworm's place \ it seems to be inside \ the cherry blossoms
bagworms \ to hear their songs \ come to my hut
without turning into a butterfly \ autumn deepens for the worm \ soon to die
yet no sign of it \ in the cidada's chirp \ stillness
piercing the rocks \ cicada's shrill \ temple bell
also sounds like it is \ cicada's voice \ cricket
forgetting sounds with its cry \ by the fireplace \ the cruelty
of being under a helmet \ a cricket \ in the cow shed
mosquito's voice darkens \ lingering heat \ on a bare branch
a crow has settled \ autumn dusk \ very exciting
yet after awhile so sad \ cormorant fishing \ a sick wild duck
falling down with the dark cold \ to sleep overnight \ a clear moon
because of his fear of foxes \ I go with my lover boy \ cloud-parting friend!
temporarily this wild goose \ must go away \ though a skylark sings
beating inside \ the pheasant's sad cry \ higher than a skylark
resting in the sky \ on a mountain pass \ spiders have a cry?
well, what is chirping \ autumn's wind? \ secretly at night
a worm under the moon \ bores into a chestnut \ banana plant in autumn storm
rain drips into tub \ hearing the night \ departing autumn
with hands spread open \ chestnut burs \ Kiso's chestnuts
for a person of the floating world \ a souvenir though autumn winds blow \ it is still green
bur of the chestnut chrysanthemum's scent \ in the garden a worn-out sandal \ just the sole
at Nara \ the fragrance of chrysanthemums \ ancient Buddhas
drinking morning tea \ the monk is peaceful \ the chrysanthemum blooms
while growing thin \ without a reason \ the chrysanthemum bud
white chrysanthemum \ catching in one's eye \ nary a speck of dust
chrysanthemums \ flowers blooming in the stones \ of the stonecutter
your hermitage \ the moon and chrysanthemums \ plus an acre of rice fields
flower of the harvest moon? \ it only looks that way \ a cotton field
autumn coolness \ hand and hand paring away \ eggplants - cucumbers
a strange flower \ for birds and butterflies \ the autumn sky
don't imitate me \ we are not two halves \ of a muskmelon
ear of the pine tree \ mushroom on a strange tree \ with a leaf stuck to it
also green \ it should remain a thing \ the pepper pod
the village so old \ there's not a single house \ without a persimmon tree
autumn begins \ sea and sprouting rice fields \ one green
failing health \ chewing dried seaweed \ my teeth grate on sand
grabbing at straws \ the strength to bear \ our parting
on this mountain \ tell me of its sorrow \ wild-yam digger
butt of the tree \ see in the cut end \ today's moon
after the flowers \ all there is left for my haiku \ wisteria beans
the crane's legs \ have gotten shorter \ in the spring rain
as for the hibiscus \ on the roadside- \ my horse ate it
It would melt \ in my hand- \ the autumn frost
A caterpillar, \ this deep in fall- \ still not a butterfly
from all these trees, \ in the salads, the soup, everywhere, \ cherry blossoms fall
the dragonfly \ can't quite land \ on that blade of grass
a crow \ has settled on a bare branch- \ autumn evening
an old pond! \ a frog jumps in- \ the sound of water
the first soft snow! \ enough to bend the leaves \ of the jonquil low
in the cicada's cry \ no sign can foretell \ how soon it must die
no one travels \ along this way but I, \ this autumn evening
in all the rains of May \ there is one thing not hidden - \ the bridge at Seta Bay
the years first day \ thoughts and loneliness; \ the autumn dusk is here
clouds appear \ and bring to men a chance to rest \ from looking at the moon
harvest moon: \ around the pond I wander \ and the night is gone
Poverty's child - \ he starts to grind the rice, \ and gazes at the moon
no blossoms and no moon, \ and he is drinking sake \ all alone!
won't you come and see \ loneliness? Just one leaf \ from the kiri tree
temple bells die out. \ the fragrant blossoms remain. \ a perfect evening!
fallen sick on a journey, \ in dreams I run wildly \ over a withered moor
Spring \ A hill without a name \ Veiled in morning mist.
The beginning of autumn \ Sea and emerald paddy \ Both the same green.
The winds of autumn \ Blow yet still green \ The chestnut husks.
A flash of lightning \ Into the gloom \ Goes the heron's cry.
Teeth sensitive to the sand \ in salad greens \ I'm getting old.
First winter rain \ even the monkey \ seems to want a raincoat.
Fleas, lice, \ a horse peeing \ near my pillow.
Coolness of the melons \ flecked with mud \ in the morning dew.
Midfield, \ attached to nothing, \ the skylark singing.
Taking a nap, \ feet planted \ against a cool wall.
The morning glory also \ turns out \ not to be my friend.
This old village \ not a single house \ without persimmon trees.
Spring rain \ leaking through the roof \ dripping from the wasps' nest.
First snow \ falling \ on the half-finished bridge.
Cold night the wild duck, \ sick, falls from the sky \ and sleeps awhile.
How admirable \ to see lightning and not think \ life is fleeting.
Blowing stones \ along the road on Mount Asama, \ the autumn wind.
Moonlight slanting \ through the bamboo grove \ a cuckoo crying.
When the winter chrysanthemums go, \ there's nothing to write about \ but radishes.
Winter garden, \ the moon thinned to a thread, \ insects singing.
Wrapping the rice cakes, \ with one hand \ she fingers back her hair.
What fish feel, \ birds feel, I don't know \ the year ending.
Heat waves shimmering \ one or two inches \ above the dead grass.
Stillness \ the cicada's cry \ drills into the rocks.
First day of spring \ I keep thinking about \ the end of autumn.
Don't imitate me \ it's as boring \ as the two halves of a melon.
The dragonfly \ can't quite land \ on that blade of grass.
Winter solitude \ in a world of one color \ the sound of wind.
The squid seller's call \ mingles with the voice \ of the cuckoo.
Bitter tasting ice \ Just enough to wet the throat \ Of a sewer rat.
The oak tree \ not interested \ in cherry blossoms.
old pond..... \ a frog leaps in \ water's sound
A snowy morning \ by myself, \ chewing on dried salmon.
Awake at night \ the sound of the water jar \ cracking in the cold.
Autumn moonlight \ a worm digs silently \ into the chestnut.
A field of cotton \ as if the moon \ had flowered.
A monk sips morning tea, \ it's quiet, \ the chrysanthemum's flowering.
A bee \ staggers out \ of the peony.
A caterpillar, \ this deep in fall \ still not a butterfly.
Ill on a journey \ my dreams wander \ over a withered moor.
I like to wash, \ the dust of this world \ In the droplets of dew.
The she cat - \ Grown thin \ From love and barley.
Passing through the world \ Indeed this is just \ Sogi's rain shelter
Since it turns out / I'm all by myself / I make friends with the harvest moon
With nothing to do, / And all alone by myself - / I'll make friends with the moon.
Even more / because of being alone / the moon is a friend.
Even more so / because of being alone / the moon is a friend.
well now, / if I am to be alone / I'll take the moon as a friend
Someone goes by wearing a hood / in his own darkness / not seeing the harvest moon
The winter wind / flings pebbles / at the temple bell
In the wild winter wind / the voice of the water cracks / falling across the rocks
The winter storm, / The voice of the rushing water, / Torn by the rocks.
Winter storm! / The roar of the waters / Tearing at the rocks.
Winter wind: the voice of water tearing through the rocks
winter wind / tearing rocks apart / the water's voice
Roaring winter wind - / The sound of a cataract / Grating on the rocks.
Cold wintry wind - / Breaking over rocks / The voice of water.
A nipping wind! / Tearing into the rock, / the voice of the water.
Blistering wind - / splintered by rocks / the voice of the water
Bean paste is being ground in a mortar / thirty-three turns / there is frost on the temple grounds
The millstone has turned / Thirty-three times in its course - / Frost on the temple.
the mill / grinds miso thirty-three times / frost at the temple
The first snow falls / then it melts / into dew on the grass
It's the first snowfall - / When it melts again we'll see / Dewdrops on the grass.
The first light snow / then when the bowl of the sky is empty / the moon hanging in the bamboos
The first snow; / Sounding it out, / The moon over the bamboos.
The first snow / Emptying itself to its last flake - / The moon above bamboo.
when the first snow / strikes the lowest culms - / bamboo in moonlight
A bamboo moon / Is caressing the round / Of early snow
A branch snaps under snow / waking me from a dream of the cherries / flowering on
This autumn evening / I feel even more lonely / than last year
Still more than last year, / It makes me feel sad and lonely - / The end of autumn.
Compared to last year, / this has even more loneliness - / autumn evening.
lonelier than last year / end of an autumn day
Still lonelier / Than last year; / Autumn evening.
More than last year, / I now feel solitude; / this autumn twilight.
More than last year / it is lonely / the autumn dusk
Even lonelier I feel / Than the year before - / Sunset in autumn.
Lonelier still than last year, / you know, / this autumn evening
Only memories of Father and Mother / come to my mind / in late autumn
Father and mother - / My thoughts keep turning to them, / At the end of autumn.
It is an autumn evening; / I think of nothing / but my parents.
Of Mother, Father / can think of nothing but / The end of autumn
In the evening, autumn; / I think only / Of my parents
It is evening, autumn; / I think only / Of my parents.
It is evening, in autumn, / All I can think of / Is my parents
In the human world / the gourd has found / a place for itself
Happiness beyond / anything I deserve / yam bulblets overflowing the basket
The monk is happily / eating his fill / of fermented bean miso soup
Washing the hoe-- / ripples on the water; / far off, wild ducks.
The old man / cutting barley-- / bent like a sickle.
White blossoms of the pear / and a woman in moonlight / reading a letter.
The behavior of the pigeon / is beyond reproach, / but the mountain cuckoo?
Before the white chrysanthemum / the scissors hesitate / a moment.
Lighting one candle / with another candle-- / spring evening.
Ploughing the land-- / not even a bird singing / in the mountain's shadow.
Calligraphy of geese / against the sky-- / the moon seals it.
Early summer rain-- / houses facing the river, / two of them
Dawn-- / fish the cormorants haven't caught / swimming in the shallows.
His Holiness the Abbot / is shitting / in the withered fields.
The spring sea rising / and falling, rising / and falling all day.
Evening wind: / water laps / the heron's legs.
The willow leaves fallen, / the spring gone dry, / rocks here and there.
My arm for a pillow, / I really like myself / under the hazy moon.
Coolness-- / the sound of the bell / as it leaves the bell.
Below are eleven Buson haiku / beginning with the phrase / 'The short night--'
The short night-- / on the hairy caterpillar / beads of dew.
The short night-- / patrolmen / washing in the river.
The short night-- / bubbles of crab froth / among the river reeds.
The short night-- / a broom thrown away / on the beach.
The short night-- / the Oi River / has sunk two feet.
The short night-- / on the outskirts of the village / a small shop opening.
The short night-- / broken, in the shallows, / a crescent moon.
The short night-- / the peony / has opened.
The short night-- / waves beating in, / an abandoned fire.
The short night-- / near the pillow / a screen turning silver.
The short night-- / shallow footprints / on the beach at Yui.
The short night- / a watery moon / stands alone over the hill
The short night-- / just as I'm falling asleep / my wife's waking up
Harvest moon-- / called at his house, / he was digging potatoes.
He's on the porch, / to escape the wife and kids-- / how hot it is!
The winter river; / down it come floating / flowers offered to Buddha.
Blown from the west, / fallen leaves gather / in the east.
Straw sandal half sunk / in an old pond / in the sleety snow.
Blow of an ax, / pine scent, / the winter woods.
Listening to the moon, / gazing at the croaking of frogs / in a field of ripe rice.
Buying leeks / and walking home / under the bare trees.
Not quite dark yet / and the stars shining / above the withered fields.
The end of spring-- / the poet is brooding / about editors.
Sparrow singing-- / its tiny mouth / open.
A bat flits / in moonlight / above the plum blossoms.
They end their flight / one by one--- / crows at dusk.
Old well, / a fish leaps-- / dark sound.
