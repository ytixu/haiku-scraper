The last warrior \ Bound atop a moonlit dune \ Fading face of tears.
Hopes dreams are born \ but without needed effort \ that's all they will be.
The ship sails through mist. \ Gold light guides the crew to shore. \ A plume rests in sand.
"Heavy burdens weighed, \ lifted high, then sent away, \ this, just for today."
The sun glides westward \ Leaving her lover behind. \ I wish she had known.
"Reflections of sky, \ just beyond the trees, there lies \ endless thoughts of blue."
"Found a dead cricket \ curled up on the porch outside, \ did it die mid-song"
Searching for answers \ To seek truth in the matter \ Find hope and meaning
Today I will kill \ myself and everyone else \ with love and kindness.
"A good friend has passed, \ faithful, loyal to the last, \ his love, now steadfast."
They live in the trees \ Sleeping soundly through the night \ Axes march below.
"Little golden fly, \ body shimmers in the sun, \ wings beating so fast."
"Woodpecker knocking, \ on the side of a tree may \ be lunch, just a hunch."
I lay my horn down \ The singing bird near my door \ plays a better blues.
Sitting in a bar \ telling lies about my life \ wishing she had stayed
"Ah, beautiful 'Net \ You astound all with just this \ Net Neutrality"
To challenge yourself \ With everything figured out \ Wanting more from life
Excited again \ Ostensible happiness \ No medication
"Sky will cloud over, \ eventually, storms pass, \ the shelter is key."
Racing Ferrari \ I Belong To The City \ Fight Miami Crime
"Moonlight saturates, \ fills spaces between spaces \ with such gentle hues."
"Young, yellow flowers \ each become a lion's paw \ in my neighbour's yard"
"Welcome, thunderstorm \ Take away the sunshine now \ Drench me in your tears"
Greatest desire \ How badly we want something \ Chase with everything
"Training on the trails, \ damp and misty day, alone, \ a young man will pray."
sitting in the car \ loving the last silence left \ i can't come in yet
"Lady in the sand, \ drawn with such love, a vision \ sent from up above."
tiny little gas \ toot-toots through my ninja pants \ betrays my presence
Procrastination \ Resisting work through choosing \ anything but work.
"Sitting at Snake River, \ tide pools swirl endlessly at \ the behest of time."
"The cicada sings \ a song of summer and sun, \ its time has begun."
Death used to scare me \ after deep self reflection \ it petrifies me
Haikus are easy \ But sometimes they don't make sense \ Refrigerator
If for your bad deeds \ the fires of Hell await \ just keep on sinning
Envision your dreams \ Take action to realize them \ They are all waiting
Falling in my dreams \ Jolting awake in my bed \ Engulfed by my fear
"Dogs chase a squirrel \ who escapes up a tree but \ still, it is on guard."
"Beavers toil all day \ to build a hut strong and good, \ they are rewarded."
"Spirits can be felt \ lining the cliffside as one, \ watching down below."
"A cool breeze descends, \ white sands at the quarry shift, \ tracks become obscured."
They didn't tell me \ Growing up meant feeling less \ Also being stressed
To be born special \ Cut from a different cloth \ Your own destiny
Concrete evidence \ of irreparable damage \ Urban wasteland sprawl
"Today, three sevens \ It's a shame the month isn't \ Sesquidecember"
"Clear, crystal waters, \ the fountain flows forth in all \ ways, for all our days."
A nourishing meal \ fills the Spirit and makes for \ a luscious appeal.
"Calm in the meadows, \ there, the horses are at play, \ galloping freely."
I need in my life \ A partner with sanity \ Solidarity.
"We forget how short \ Life really is, until death \ Takes loved ones from us"
"Daydreaming again, \ the waterfall has power \ roaring on the stone."
Submit a haiku \ Seems simple enough to me. \ Welp...I got nothing.
In trembling hands \ Must decide on gambling \ Take the chance and roll
She lifted her drink \ bringing it to blood red lips \ trying not to smile
a stormy ocean \ lightning in the warm shallows \ finds reeds immortal
"A sparkling lagoon, \ sunset illuminates the \ seashells and round rocks."
To talk a big game \ Something anyone can do \ Get things done instead
"Piece of a cocoon \ drifts followed by a lone wisp, \ Mother, you are glad."
"The bird calls, the leaf \ then falls, down to the Earth where \ all the insects crawl."
The sun is warm and \ pure on grass that grows green and \ ultimately sure.
We all crave success \ Everyone wants victory \ But to get it done
hiding emotion \ once reaction is feared \ truth gets triage
"A spotted rabbit \ cleans its fur, then leaves things just \ as they always were."
"Mosquitoes, although \ bothersome, must have their place \ upon the spectrum."
"Steam rising from a \ morning cup of tea, raindrops \ all seem to agree."
"The height of greatness \ Demands a riskier fall \ In other words, climb"
somber reminder \ painful tightness in my chest \ rejection again

"man becomes machine \ in material magic \ road trips, radar blips"
"Epic unfolded, \ bowing before the Lingam, \ she came back to me."
Squirrel's shadow climbs \ up a willow tree and looks \ back briefly at me.
Bias for action \ Difference for go-getters \ Diligent effort
My trepidation \ of future darkness is just \ a fear of sunsets.
"Lost, in the woods he \ searches for the red canoe \ that has long since gone"
"Brilliant light, but short lived \ Shallow and driven by fear \ Sharp breath, feel the pain"
"Summer rain falls soft, \ leaves turned up drink it in by \ standing firmly straight."
Her top lip trembles \ but her hands ball into fists \ she won't let me win
Sex in style of Dog \ in and out...In and Out...Makes \ me want to say WOOOOOOOFFF
We are all monsters \ Lying about who we are \ Longing for release
Sometimes I feel like \ I am drowning in this world \ Suffering alone
"Caged turtle somehow \ flies, leading us through strange rooms \ without any doors."
one god in the hand \ worth two in the burning bush \ paper money
Like a bird she sang \ I fell in love with her voice \ And listened all day
An absence of fear \ Courage so liberating \ Now unstoppable
I lose track of time \ when you melt into my arms. \ Cheezey like cheddar
Raindrops start to fall \ They start to drip down my face \ mixing with my tears
"Recalculating, \ incompatibility \ ...inevitable."
"owing to prison \ I went homosexual \ hey, once you go black..."
On mother's birthday \ I gave her painted orchids \ which have since wilted
Ants on the deck toil \ so hard to make it across \ the cracks heading home.
Beautiful daisy \ Our perfection simplified \ Not in my garden
"High up, staring down \ Filled with fear, unknown below \ Take the daring plunge"
Sisyphean Hell \ Trapped forever repeating \ 30 goto 10
Pain buried in chest \ Stress overwhelming my life now \ Succumbing to the bottle
When feeling behind \ To strive to do a bit more \ Closer and closer
"Sad, stressed, soft bodies \ Posion in the veins and carts \ Grocery store at 5"
Petal upon wind \ Roses take to centre stage \ Stand frozen in time
American Gold- \ finch swoops in to say hello \ before the rains come.
A keystroke away \ A young boy's life on the line \ Unforgiving web
"A friend asks me to \ take the wheel, Crane flies down which \ doesn't feel that real."
"Unkempt and wild lawn, \ fresh raspberries grow in no \ particular way."
Certainty never \ got anyone anywhere. \ I prefer my chaos.
Playing with fire \ Dangerous embers to spark \ Do not get burned now
I now believe in \ moments so perfect even \ a poem can t express.
The same fight again \ Carves out my heart with her words \ Drops it on the ground
crumpled on the ground \ gravity for heavy hearts \ unsent love letters
The sound a family neighbors post box lid makes \ as a heavy envelope slides inside \ and the lid snaps closed.
"Honeysuckle, the \ rain brings it on the fresh air, \ free from bleak despair."
A sheet and flashlights \ Shadow puppets spring to life \ Someone flips the bird
I've never wanted \ to hold any other hand as \ much as I do yours.
The heat of summer \ Keeping cool by thinking cool \ Scorching temperatures
"Mists on the Hudson, \ dreary to some, tonight there \ couldn't be more love."
Ifrit's song singes \ Hairs on the nape of my neck \ I am mystified
Wipe sweat off your brow \ Sit in the shade for a while. \ You have earned a rest.
What does my son want \ Muscle milk and power bars \ Have some Cheerios.
"Why, just a question \ Double meaning loaded Why \ would anyone miss me"
Faced with biggest fears \ A logical solution \ Find inner courage
if rain doesn't know \ of its' upcoming rebirth \ what do humans know
Calmly he sits there \ Waiting for stranger to leave \ Public poops take time
Failure on one hand \ A contrasting universe \ Success in the end
A night in Forest . \ . The trees are fired up by \ Fireflies
The wind blows slowly. \ The sun is up on the sky. \ Oh it's so hot now
The darkest despair \ Glimmering hope shining through \ The brink of madness
Defining moment \ Where everything will make sense \ Fully brace yourself
"Eyes shut at the beach \ Cross kicks and lindy turns \ Dancing, in my mind."
"I love the evening \ It's when I get kissed by tea, \ The cup makes me sleep ."
grayscale horizon \ starlight symbiosis shell \ pulls up the blanket
"Restraint, a concept \ Socially great cowardly \ For those free to choose"
A sea of green blades. \ Aspiring for sun's favour. \ Flames from a dead star.
I've always loved rain. \ Its cosmical mistery \ Gives me nice feelings
An old aquarium . \ Fishes are swimming slowly . \ Dad is feeding them.
Still frozen in place \ On the other side of fear \ Break past barriers
We sit in silence. \ The air conditioner hums. \ It gets colder still.
"I am Higgs' boson \ Yes, but which one, you will say \ Pick one... there I am"
provocative scent \ a spring time embrace. engorged \ petals undulate
the hips of a rose \ held open for the season \ moist with the seeding
a question of size \ color is incidental \ but it's always black
Even on rough days \ Do not let it get you down \ Always tomorrow
"Your beautiful smile. \ The confidence in your eyes. \ I love you, mirror."
Broken Promises \ Scent of bacon not for me \ Men in yoga pants
Jam Session I look at my watch \ I know there is no point \ Four minutes have passed
outside of the rain \ and its pure place in nature \ standing in this house
A brown leaf flutters \ gently severed from it's home \ to become the earth
"Hurt, without a wound \ is soul without a body. \ then you see yourself."
oh no teenage boys \ are threatening my worldview \ can't handle reddit
Blood like Espresso \ Bean-Black heart skips and shudders \ Bitter and obscene
I Still Remember \ Your Long Red Hair In Summer \ I Wish You Were Back
momentary sleep \ but brevity can't restrain \ my unfulfilled dreams
Hunger motivates \ Now compelled to take action \ Satisfy hunger
i wrote twelve haiku \ i lost the pages \ this is the phoenix
"Heavy bough of plum \ lightens, in a summer gust \ soft thud in the grass"
crumpled craft paper \ waft of cinnamon and glue \ still disappointed
Born with a purpose \ Finding a reason to live \ A meaning achieved
Haiku lack limits \ Except for the obvious \ Limits that they have.
"Planning ahead is \ Something I rarely get right, \ especially when"

Useless excuses \ We all can cough up reasons \ Only reasons speak
I realized that it's \ hard to say I still love her \ as she walks away
"A painful goodbye \ reconciliation, then \ more painful goodbyes"
Mystery solving \ When searching for right answers \ Ask vital questions
Conversation ends \ single tear rolls down her cheek \ turns so I can't see
I require freedom \ Knotted heart strings can untie \ Fear must be strangled
Without urgency \ Procrastination occurs \ Need a strong reason
"my mother's dog died \ sigh, now i have to help change \ all of her passwords"
bottled bravery \ toilet faced instead of fears \ everything flushed
Do not put things off \ Later can become never \ So just get started
a question about \ the form haiku lines must take \ need they be complete
Yes steam summer sale \ I am getting all that's avail \ now i'm winter pale
Do you still love me \ I ask - as she lies in bed \ Pretending to sleep
Obstacles in front \ Greatness behind barriers \ Break past these high walls
So full of spirit \ Filled with many desires \ Direction needed
The wind was howling \ Her moans were louder than it \ Daddy never knew.
Finding the reason \ A constant search for answers \ Eventually
I called her repeatedly \ she kept on ignoring me \ until i get dressed
"Broken cobblestones \ Carve a path through dappled trees \ Take a breath, press on."
Death by the screen light \ Forgotten by the morning \ Nothing matters less
"The winds of Autumn, \ brought gifts a thousand miles away. \ ."
"Learning something new \ To sharpen every thought \ The mind, a weapon"
If women loved men \ It would not be such a trend \ To split and divorce.
Humans went extinct \ The unfulfilled potential \ Filled the universe
The day she left us \ Our dog could not stop howling \ And neither could I.
Beneath the surface \ Lies the darkest of secrets \ Let the bright light shine
"Warm, sad skies above \ I wonder if they can dream \ They wonder can I"
Rainfall from dark skies \ Soothing covers for dark times \ Will I sleep tonight
"Croissants for breakfast \ Crispy bacon, runny eggs \ Cappuccino too"
Challenging oneself \ For finding the breaking point \ Overcome it all
Father's day letter \ Try to mend old rifts and new \ Espresso and tears
trapped in a timeweb \ my silky sorrows river \ eight eyed kin swim there
something old and new \ borrows from all of our wounds \ blood anemic blue
Noon warmth on my skin \ I see why many people \ worship the sun god.
"Writing your story \ Each chapter, unexpected \ Telling a great tale"
memory's captives \ the romanticizing slaves \ dance on all these graves
something from nothing \ a quantum fluctuation \ birthed all that I love
Ingredients found \ Just brewing something special \ Perfect recipe
the gift of no fame \ only being known by \ old childhood friends
I hope that my hair \ Looks like a dying cockroach \ Like I want it to
Has your day been well \ She says it differently. \ My day becomes great.
"Our sensei taught us this today, translation in the body \  \ "
Not stuck in one place \ As time can and will heal all \ So temporary
While chasing my dreams \ instead I discovered \ the deepest of griefs
Doing drugs at home \ wallowing in self pity \ better than working.
moving into the sun \ the cat takes with her \ some leafy shadow
perpetually \ yesterday's tomorrow \ forgets its grand dreams
"What are mods gonna \ do, remove me they haven't \ been active in months"
Whispers full of fear \ Filling a person with doubt \ Refuse to listen
"A famous Haiku from the book I'm reading, translation in the body \  \ "
how ill be recalled \ as a gift or curse or worse \ not recalled at all
So slowly the pull \ But when string reaches apex \ Fast flies the arrow
Rain pummels the roof \ Thunder and lightning explode \ Coffee soothes the cold.
"Chirruping cicadas \ Shimmering, smothering heat \ Where is the sea breeze"
I do our laundry \ Many clothes to be folded \ Most are yours of course
"I do not want to \ break your spirit, so instead \ I will break my heart"
Complex thoughts within \ An inner conversation \ Figure it all out
Through harsh resistance \ Strength and character will build \ So tough it all out
the day is too hot \ for the outfit i'm wearing \ should have done laundry
As the years go by \ Whisky is a better friend \ Than birthday cake is.
"I sift through the shards \ of what could have been, until \ my hands and heart bleed."
dark clouds hover here \ broad boughs offer protection \ walk the path anyways
It's true we all lie \ I think mostly to ourselves \ I can't believe me
Making a long list \ Detailed from top to bottom \ The ultimate plan
In a cruel world \ Good intentions become key \ Rise above evil
I don't want to work \ Want to bang the drum all day \ Reggae anyone
A plan in motion \ Just carefully considered \ Well executed
Day off work today \ adventure spirit is high \ temperature cold
I'm he which you seek \ the bearer of your vices \ devil of your hell
I killed all the ants \ So beautiful when they're dead \ Now I must clean them
Kill the little ants \ They're everywhere and are cute \ I must kill them all
In the winds of change \ A sudden transformation \ Become ultimate
Do not run from death \ Cold winds fly through this great cliff \ Darkness surrounds all
To beat the reaper \ One must live the fullest life \ Not the longest life
I'm Jerry Seinfeld \ Why do people like hugging \ Kesha sure loves to
In the freezing snow \ it's snowing on Mount Fuji \ I can't feel my balls
glass lantern resigns \ quietly its post till dawn \ the wind says too much
A dream envisioned \ The ultimate fantasy \ Too good to be true
"There is no heaven \ Nor hell, but that the mind makes \ You choose for yourself"
pale phosphorescence \ from the glass of grapefruit juice \ on a summer morn
these are your choices \ delusion or depression \ happiness or truth
Stand outside stretch and \ Bathe yourself in the rain \ Before summer finds you.
The way your eyes smiled \ I appreciated all \ wasn't mutual
"rake the autumn leaves \ winter will conquer all \ hearts heal, usually"
The plan of attack \ Picturing complete success \ Mind over matter
"Don't doubt the answer \ sometimes, question the question \ and see which is wrong"
a broken hearts' love \ burns deep in the afterthoughts \ water is coolness
No lingering warmth \ drank to erase memories \ I'll move on in time
Feet firmly on ground \ Your eyes on the horizon \ Toward destiny
I would take the bus \ To the train to the ferry \ To a cab to you
Down in the deep dark \ Deeper they go always down \ In Earth the deep dwarves....
On the misty lake \ The visions of ages long past \ Still doth lurk yonder....
In a series of \ Ones and zeros we collide \ Longing for less space
Your sleepy breath a \ Metronome against my skin \ Reinventing time.
"Big picture, hidden \ The pieces of a puzzle \ Connecting them all"
grappling for a thought \ dark blue beyond the window \ abducts the senses
Ever so fragile \ These eggshells I'm walking on \ With thundering feet
Below the surface \ Discovering the true you \ Beneath the facade
Fragrant phenols fade \ deftly stealing young beans' souls \ just grind what you need
"Alone one will go \ into nature, contemplate \ the Dao, a trial."
Paint a cow pie gold \ It isn't a gold nugget \ It's shiny bullshit.
"Dear mountain lion \ you know I can see you too \ aloof, you remain."
As I Grow Older \ I Can Feel The Years Gone Past \ Weighing Down On Me
The main difference \ Between those who can and can t \ Lies in willpower
Up early again \ No sleeping in for this pup \ Slobber wake up call
Crooked media \ Negative press covfefe \ I have the best words
"I cut myself deep. \ Though only accidental, \ I asked for no help."
"Failure is common \ so fail at some wild dreams first \ then, settle for less."
"scaling up and up \ abyss, fingers cross through keys \ jump over thumbs down"
Even if you fail \ Just to fall flat on your face \ Get up - try again
It is cold inside \ My mind sits under dark clouds \ The sun dries me out
I made you an app \ Where haiku travel the world \ Contribute your verse
Decisive moment \ So capable of changing \ The key turning point
This reality \ All my dreams have woken up \ I'll never be great
"sweet voice by my ear \ soft kisses surround my heart \ I love, the first time"
Newborn baby says \ To double-hearted mother \ Now you're on your own
Fire burns within \ Passion turns into a blaze \ I will fan the flames
Thin voices through wall \ too cold to answer sleep's call \ might read tokyo ghoul
his little Tarzan \ boldly peeks through the loincloth \ as he swings the vine
The courage to live \ Destiny in your own hands \ Luxury of choice
Sun's been gone for days \ Dark clouds with no break in sight \ Birds are still out though
On the mound of crap \ a lone kernel of corn lay \ only it prevails
"another pint, sir \ my death by misadventure \ on the horizon"
"Four weeks, no classes \ What to do with precious time \ Before it passes"
"You can kill two birds \ with one stone, or just watch them \ and be happier"
Up at 6A.M. \ Pale light squirms through the windows \ He hopes to sleep soon
To find your purpose \ Focusing on the journey \ Reaching the main goal
I DO deserve this \ The comfort eater's mantra \ Saturated fats
The sunburned wall face \ Stands at ease for centuries \ Throughout the mountains.
"The sky is now clear, \ we bask in shades of deep blue \ Shiva, we feel you."
"My top-heavy heart \ swells only to fall over \ and over, again"
"A housefly buzzes \ it's dead now. That's life, I guess \ inside these windows"
Always biding time \ Taking too long for a move \ Just go for it now
Need new contacts \ Better choose wisely \ A new religion
"Memories are pain \ The Sun is out, yet it rains \ Everything will fade"
Avoidance of eyes \ Tremor in the autumn wind \ Gaze of apathy
these delicate eyes \ held back tears upon a word \ voiced so suddenly
Breaking points take place \ But holding it together \ One s resolve tested
Staring silently \ Canvas defiled from paint \ The artist gives up.
"Forgetting, it's like \ Holes into an empty house \ Abandoned, hopeless..."
"Call, Call of the void \ See him rising from the tide \ Madness made matter"
"We sit in silence \ wondering, why do we mourn \ for only our dead"
"These are your hands, flint \ Now strike the tinder of art \ Light your legacy"
"ran over something \ felt the thump, too dark to see \ boy does my butt itch"
Gears in head spinning \ Just so many ideas \ Thinking to the max
"Mists on the Hudson, \ dreary to some, tonight, there \ can't be more to love."
"Bending low, he cries \ the prince mourns his now lost bride \ the ladybug flies."
Pink petals scattered \ but I recall her lessons \ in saying yellow .

she is not concerned \ about his room being neat \ she'd lie in clothes piles
Though good intentions \ All ambitions need action \ To do more than dream
like glass raindrops cut \ Begin descent behind me \ like raindrops glass falls
"Coo coo, mourning dove \ Coo your little heart out. Coo \ Just don't poop on me."
I hate how it sounds \ With the music turned way down \ Too vulnerable
"Desert wind, hot, dry \ draws the scent of a river \ from budding green trees"
"Clinging to something \ Just refusing to let go \ Sometimes, it s OK"
meds aren't working \ nicotine gum is not real \ very few things are
gazing out my window \ I wonder when a baby tree \ will blossom tender leaves
Unblossomed tulips \ Standing in a dusky field \ Waving in the sun.
Equation for life \ A challenging solution \ Solvable indeed
Your spirit resides \ In my surreal fantasies \ Not to fill the void
The trust I would place \ How I embraced your sweet grace \ Unreturned it stays.
Give life some meaning \ Every moment matters \ Until your last breath
Artists are pirates \ No need for rhyme or reason \ Give and take as pleased
Lets make poetry \ Once a week or any time \ Just because we can
Always in control \ Sole responsibility \ That person is you
I Am So Afraid \ Of How Unpredictable \ The Future Can Be
We became enslaved \ by the audio they grew \ in their soundgarden
The lines on her face \ Are like a map of her soul-- \ The moments she's lived.
We can still be friends \ But it will be different \ What about our plans
"Bashir al-Assad \ He is our savior and god \ For him, we must plod"
Even at your worst \ Never an eternal state \ To strive for your best
The night is quiet \ A letter came in today \ The stars are calming
You would dance with Death \ Mindful of his sharpened scythe \ Soon for your reaping
Veins are full of fire \ Lava cleanses tortured souls \ yet also corrupts
woke up from a dream \ same ugly reality \ the teeth marks are new
Dazzling display \ Potential unleashed fully \ The world now impressed
Your acquired skills \ Determination driven \ True talent will speak
vinegary balls \ I just had to write that down \ what were the complaints
freezing winds roaring \ tracks on the snowy mountain \ tiger in my path
"Life's not fair , you say \ as though making that statement \ excused your choices"
Picking up pieces \ even if I find them all \ what is really left
The darkest hour \ Facing the worst fears ever \ Hope will shine its light
Blood of Patriot \ Spilled in DC last July \ His name was Seth Rich
I've been numb for days \ Chrysalis in my stomach \ Where butterflies wait

dear departed wife \ the rough hole in your tombstone \ has chafed my penis
My heart a surging spring \ Forore water to parched souls \ Abandoned well
Every moment \ Destiny builds up slowly \ Eventually
1 50 AM \ This mattress is so empty \ And I feel empty
Ethereal beauty \ Achilles-like perfection \ Flows within your veins
Infatuation \ I only think in colors \ Have I found a muse
Beneath golden hair \ A face reserved for Angels \ How did you get here
Drowning in despair \ With all of your might and strength \ Swim to happiness
He crept next to me \ While I dreamed slept there all night. \ I killed that spider.

Outside the clinic \ Protesters marching \ on cherry blossoms
Cloudburst \ Nestled in the wire fence... \ Robin's eggs
Daffodils blooming \ around a huge oak tree stump \ Where is our father
It's time to move on \ The horizon is calling \ My new home awaits
Change is everything. \ What was born will surely die. \ All is illusion.
"Busy, but focused, \ the inchworm measures his path \ without rest or pause."
"In the rooster's mind, \ crowing proudly ev'ry morn, \ he brings forth the sun."
Bringing out the best \ Determination tenfold \ Even more needed
"Apes hum a sweet tune \ Other Apes say, hum for cash, \ Their hums grew somber"
Bait the enemy \ To draw first blood and to draw \ Last breath. Hawk traps snake
Proper footing. Set \ Measuring space between us. \ Who sets the trap off
Light shines through the clouds \ like spotlights from the heavens \ illuminating
I sang a sad song \ and in the silence after \ I heard rain outside.
while we all agree \ that bullying is no joke \ your penis size is
Jade frog fractured nose \ on its side in ribbon river \ smooth and cold and clean
Southern wind blows cold \ Snow has fallen in the hills \ Summer is over.
No motivation \ Why must these essays exist \ Uni apps - much fun
A cloud of despair \ A sad veil blocking vision \ Yet happy rays shine
fine weather withers \ away yellow leaves - leaves way \ for green ice cinders
I left her breathless \ just able to gasp my name \ passionate release
Chattering sparrows \ Flee before the strength'ning wind \ I must face the storm
Pain needs no reason \ nor does it need an ending \ or explanation
"Closure is bullshit \ It isn't given, take it \ pick up and move on."
These pieces don't fit \ but time will arrange their place \ when reasons cannot
Where one is going \ A destination in mind \ To the perfect place
"Naked as peasants \ in sheets of a king, thy queen \ she's left the palace"
Those I loved have gone \ All that gives me pleasure too \ Life goes on and on
The baby cries deep \ Mad with fervor at the Twix \ That hangs to mock me
Arena called life \ To hold your own or to die \ Choose to fight instead
last line of defense \ spirals out counterclockwise \ penned lowercase e
Grasp my butt firmly \ smooth shaft is pulled through my hand \ just playing some pool
A sunshiney day \ pleasant breezes calm the heat \ day of happiness
"Poisoning the gut \ Calamari escapades \ Ordinary broth, is not"
Blue sky lifts me up \ vertigo takes me away \ I fly from the earth
Will sleep come easy \ dreading lying wide awake \ mind continues on
The best time to start \ Just when and where to begin \ Answer here and now
Tea with jam and bread \ perfect sunny side-up eggs \ today's a good day
Shifting seasons. Up. \ Birds stare down the quiet city \ Do they remember home
A gift from heaven \ Brings a modest bowl of rice \ Two spoons are needed
Those I loved have gone \ All that gives me pleasure too \ Life goes on and on
Tools in possession \ Everything needed to solve \ All problems now fixed
Watch the lights flutter \ in my heart your world is secured \ forever hold me close
Will someone kill my \ heart so that it will at last \ stop hurting me so
Who is up voting \ poems about nothing at all \ willow weeps outside
I write them all here \ because I lack the courage \ in that other world
"First post in this sub \ Using my fingers to count \ Oh yeah, this is fun"
My comical life \ practical jokes and bloopers \ I forgot to laugh
"Went to Costcutter \ Freddos now 35p \ Thanks a lot, Brexit"
Whisper me your thoughts \ secrets hold to memory \ clinging in my mind
POTUS Proposes \ The Mother of All Tax Cuts \ Just Got a Boner
"A declaration \ Boldly daring, full of hope \ Faith moving forward"
Peterbilt sunrise \ pour another cup of joe \ got to get rollin'
Under bird feeder- \ winter's forgotten food bits \ reborn in spring mud
deep into the well \ a silver coin fell the wall \ hit a sliver bit
ordered Indian \ threw away my underwear \ shortly thereafter
"Dancing in the light, \ The shadows fall to my feet. \ I can feel the sun."
her kind wrinkled skin \ and bright red lips clash with her \ handlebar moustache
The taste of your skin \ I devour you to the bone \ I love fried chicken
Little spider friend \ Nimble architect of webs \ Woven with magic
"Thoughts, the mental storm \ Bolts of creativity \ Shocked, now inspired"
I cannot go on \ You loving life without me \ Me slowly fading.
"we're clean out of love \ you tell me this, turn, and sleep \ I jack off wildly"
Pen of faith in hand \ Writing out one s own story \ A happy ending
"I'm dreaming again \ I smell birch forest in Spring \ then wake up, it's gone."
Roll into Compton \ like a loose cannon. Smokin' \ big green Bruce Banner.
"Deep as this pain is, \ deeper is the love I've felt \ for you in my soul."
Online friends often \ Fade away when they are not \ online any more.
You rejected me \ I tried to get over you \ I'll never succeed
With faith in yourself \ Fueled with steadfast resolve \ Brilliance in motion
Cut off some choices \ Make THE single decision \ Major turning point
just like that she's gone \ shifted into hourglass sands \ condemned to mem'ry
"Turn frown upsidedown \ Great, now inside out \ Looks like we need a root canal"
Adding to the menu \ Shoelace spaghetti sundae \ Crayons we thank you
"The sun will explode. \ the scientists have proclaimed \ , and I believe it"
bittersweet backyard \ heaven's haven from failure \ sunshines and setbacks
"The strength of your own \ Stored within, at beck and call \ Maximum power"
I carry around \ a box of melancholy \ it gets out sometimes
"on a sailing ship \ I've not done gay stuff, I quipped \ but that was soon fixed"
"White Album playing \ While My Guitar Gently Weeps \ George, RIP Mate"
My car rusts gently \ In the night I hear it go \ ow ow ow ow ow.
with each piss at work \ I come closer to my goal \ ninety beer cans full
An actual dream \ Filled entirely with hope \ The ongoing chance
An Apple tree swoons \ Mid-harvest leaves falling down \ Like rain on my cheeks
To the car he runs \ A yearning for freedom lost \ laziness at home
Capable of much \ To realize one s talent \ Beyond powerful
The night becomes light \ The dawn is now upon us \ Your fate awaits you.
jacksfilms on youtube \ hooked me on his haiku theme \ now i can't stop help
My final paper \ referencing was needed \ 10k is too much
Emotions in flux \ Further frustration mounting \ A deep breath needed
tortured by sweet dreams \ where we are still together \ i miss my nightmares
Writing haiku is \ There are not enough sylla- \ Every line is too
Desire in mind \ Doing everything needed \ Making it happen
Let me run \ I don't need this anymore \ Take a breath
This haiku will take \ Your breath away when you read \ It underwater.
"Days flow together, \ dried leaves rest on the living, \ wind choosing their fate."
Sunday for Easter \ Joyous day for family \ Celebrate with glee
A decision made \ An ultimate destiny \ Chasing after fate
Dreaming of times lost \ Amongst visions of what was \ Known only to some.
My heart is broken \ What the frigging hell. Screw this \ I want some ice cream
the starving wolf growls \ while on the ground unnoticed \ by the hunting owls
Believe to believe \ Every conviction counts \ Must stand by your thoughts
two pink slippers stand \ alone on a street corner \ to parents' dismay
The mob types for more \ digital colosseum \ for a viral war
"Even with no clear goal, \ I know I'll get there someday. \ Stress along the way."
Im looking to find \ In a never ending grind \ Some peace of my mind
The answer to woe \ Is smiling back at the world \ That angers you so
Washing hands in the sink \ Urge to pee creeps \ I have accomplished nothing
"The Crane flies by as \ The Rooster crows, where She stops, \ Noone shows or knows."
five whiskies later \ I'm not manly but I'm drunk \ right now that's enough
"Actions need purpose \ Why, why, why, why, why, why, why \ A defined motive"
Soft white wave strings soar \ Lensed on tide lords pockmarked shield \ Darkness waits for now.
"Failures, one by one \ Quietly counting each loss \ Eventual win"
"inserted ham hocks \ good sir, inspect my buttocks \ did I do it right"
"pinned by a small girl \ I embarrassed my father \ Daddy, please I yelled"
You made me a meme \ when you kicked me off that plane \ i have to go home
Winds of change blowing \ Destiny in your control \ Resolve setting sail
"Opportunity \ poetic and ironic \ it knocks, only once."
Poised in majesty \ Beams of silken light shimmer \ A tarantula.
I'd made a right turn \ When I reached Albuquerque \ I should have gone left
Lacking direction \ One will wander aimlessly \ Have a place in mind
Reality shows \ Scripted and not genuine \ Kind of like people
new theatre show \ about syntax and grammar \ just a play on words
tricked by a Crane Kick \ when he can just sweep the leg \ fucking idiot
"I'm sure you are nice \ But I just don't like people \ so please, go away"
I feel numb. So numb. \ How could I feel anything \ When she's all I felt
Like birthday candles \ Dwindling relentlessly \ Dancing with the breath.
A well of knowledge \ Shared eagerly with the world \ Your gift to others
Beside humble creek \ A 5 stumping of sitting \ Calls to the weary
A pale moon reveals \ a ghostly beach suspended \ in an endless dawn
"If brevity is \ the soul of wit, then haikus \ are the souls of poetry"
Haikus are easy \ and life isn't so easy \ but haikus help me
A darkened spirit \ The moon shine illuminates \ White lightning shadows.
delightfulness is \ like a hand feeding birds \ hold them and they flee
Running in Norwich \ Humidity is so high \ Boxers need changing
"Crossing a threshold \ So close, yet so far away \ Forward you must go"
Footsteps in the sand \ Drops of silver dance behind \ The memory fades.
a toast to the urn \ in pictures and war medals \ the dead share a laugh
The Swallows follow \ from where the Sun sets on the \ prophecy fulfilled.
metal skeleton \ with a punk rock patella \ oh the iron knee
What I know I'll show \ Listen close to what I say \ But don't be like me
With an imperfect plan \ Some tweaks needed at some point \ Perfectly normal
Discouraging words \ Tuned out with positive thoughts \ Noise to cancel out

Trial and error \ Much potential discovered \ Greatness realized
where the river pools \ lean against the old oak tree \ perfect reflection
calm like a puddle \ begging to be messied up \ loins begin to stir
a blow to mammon \ the removal of bannon \ has become canon
Waterboy on tube \ high quality H20 \ foozball's the devil
"With the towel thrown \ Only then can full defeat \ Take place, so hold on"
Restless leg syndrome \ keeping me awake kicking \ guess I'll watch t.v.
some use 'space slash space' \ some use 'no space slash no space' \ I use 'space slash space'

does life get sweeter \ he thought while holding her hand \ i don't want to know
"Kind of misleading \ Snow peas are NOT made of snow \ Really, they're just peas"
she has smoke and bone \ and soot and incantation \ I have stone and faith
Right turns on wrong path \ Left me going in circles \ For too many years
headlights flickering \ past night shrouded hospital \ snoring from the bed
A hundred and ten \ divided by eleven \ is equal to ten
I am what I am \ Rice sacks will always hold rice \ Dinner is ready
This song reminds me \ Of our lives together \ Points of empty air
An ocean of time \ washing debris of ages \ on the shores of now.
by local standards \ these Chinese are well-endowed \ you can tell they're male
My zipper is down \ No one has told me all day \ Who are my real friends
"Murals of distant \ Lands, painted on the walls of \ Crumbling buildings"
some cheerful violence \ with a near affection for \ your adversary
Fill my mouth with meat \ Chipotle's a tasty treat \ Makes me twist my teats
Deep blue to yellow \ slap myself twice on the cheeks \ two hundred to go
"What burns She asked him, \ her eyes glistening. He said, \ All you imagine."
"Structured syllabic meter is \ important to some, but \ matters very little to me"
burying the past \ ransoms for grave-robbing guilt \ self-pity shovels
For a few moments \ Longing for a place to rest \ 'Twas merely a dream
Take your heart of faith \ Mice and men down to your fate \ Stand on shores unseen
"Behold, in great depth \ how infinite our oceans \ yet, so unexplored."
"No one there s named Kim \ Or ever been, but outside \ a man howls her name."
A heart is a fist \ a reverberating red \ life's sweet metronome
"Sunlight through curtains \ brightens room and ushers day. \ It can fuck off, though."
"You'd be four by now \ her choice made, not mine to change \ gaping ache of loss"
"Imagined terror \ Blood on the green, the seagulls \ in the aftermath."
"Who's seen our neighbor \ It's been days, and in her house \ a dog is howling."
Like moths to the flame \ the world outside calls to me \ never to return
calm gives way to gasps \ between anxious rolling swells \ mental state decays
Push through hallways quick \ This is the gay agenda \ Educate the mass
one empty seat \ next to mine on the plane \ time to try again
"Crisp air, melting snow \ groundhog day dawning again \ Sun is so blinding"
Thunder following \ lightning's flash through the clouds \ snowfall so peaceful
Head against your heart \ Each beat a moment of peace \ Take me within you.
I look at my dick \ pondering pork-based products \ is it different
Darth Plageuis The Wise \ It's an old Sith Legend \ Jedi will not tell
"I want to hold you \ As I'm seeing you crying \ Notice me, honey"
Your hands so tiny \ reaching for candy and toys \ what a world you'll see
"The broken wing of \ a bird, Endless spinning, Life, \ without direction."
Ice cycles hanging \ from leafless maple branches \ January harvest
World blanketed in \ greyish-white cloud. Cars beeping \ Highway to unknown
Dad after drab day \ of dreary sky overhead \ remember the sun
I came from the woods \ clouds have covered up the sun \ the wind's air is fresh
My love for you burns \ With the hot intensity \ Of a thousand Suns.
"A bare rented room \ dimly lit, unfamiliar \ many thoughts, one tear"
from near the bar door \ cold night sweeps over the crowd \ the blues piano
"The wind blows, you speak \ I can't hear the syllables \ The words drowned in sound"
excited by pork \ wraps prosciutto 'round his dick \ a hamsexual
now i've burned myself \ and what did i find inside \ coal for the next fire
Instagram heartache \ the kind that makes you wish that \ they never left home
Time moves so slowly \ more homework keeps on piling \ the tortures of school
My wife feeds our child \ The same way she was fed. I \ Wait for something new.
Bus drivers are cool \ They drive lots of kids around \ Kids can't drive themselves
With a mighty leap \ the determined koi becomes \ a golden gragon
"Mom's spaghetti, Yum \ It is ready to eat, Yum \ Mom's spaghetti's done"
"Folks keep gifting me \ Especially, when it s not my birthday \ Indistinguishable scars"
Rocks are really hard \ Or sometimes they can be soft \ Depends on the rock
a clean bill of health \ we will not show you mercy \ heroes never die
If all life on earth \ Had died and rotted away \ The sky would still rain
quiet evening \ in the middle of nowhere \ the tree line opens
I long for that warmth \ trickling from her underside \ eyes closed I am found
Sun shining wanly \ ice wind rattling windows \ white curtain fell fast
All above my head \ Are the skies and the cosmos \ Conjoined with our minds
Stray man walks alone \ in a lonely universe \ First opens his eyes
The crestfallen snow \ I walk but leave no footprints \ my gravestone is bare
"my thoughts, like the clouds \ swept by the cool evening wind \ wandering the sky"
With four simple chords \ and a pocketful of grief \ I'll color the sky
I struggle with it \ the thought of never closing \ fingers round her nape
humanity gone \ a warm welcome from the lost \ we're all Hollows here
A touch of silver \ colours my partner s hair \ tis treasure to me.
Winter s chill in air \ I seek warmth in blankets \ lover holds me close
The winter winds wail \ Singing a song of snowfall \ Ice mirrors the clouds
"with this paring knife \ we set upon the prepuce \ oh, gay discipline"
The street is barren \ Chock full of cars and houses \ Still empty to me
"Leader at the top \ If so, did you start below \ Sacrifices made"
White pearly ocean \ Extends borders without ends \ Tempts to be sailed upon
Wetness of my soles \ Sweat and reeks of repugnance \ Slip off my slippers
The boisterous wind \ twirls the fallen leaves in dance \ 'Round in a bound circle
Whispers of the night \ Traffic lights trickle colored \ Light streaks through the town
I'm bad at haikus \ No matter how hard i try \ I just can't quite get it
"3 pm, sleepy \ But wide awake by midnight \ Circadian fail"
surrounded by flame \ through it I can see her smile \ burns brighter than fire
"Saucy meat and cheese \ Spaghetti in my mouth, please. \ Noodles Al dente"
Bumper hidden by \ billowing thick white curtain \ January drive
We made love softly \ Outside the tent. The sound \ blends with crickets.
A cold joyful day \ snow falls to form a pallet \ angels are abound
gray winds thunder down \ the pacific overlook \ charcoal green and blue
this is what I do \ and this is how I do it \ boring in the end
Image captured \ by a minimum of words \ A perfect Haiku
A Haiku poem \ is but seventeen syllables \ a frozen moment
A God awful smell \ It's coming from over there \ Something must have died
encumbered boughs bend \ barren trees slice the gale \ I am empty too
smiles fade like the sun \ every night of our dance \ footsteps out of sync
lost in the Congo \ gay cannibal savages \ devour my penis
date ends abruptly \ failed to wash my genitals \ vinegary rot
"man from Nantucket \ once existed, but that's all \ this format allows"
Superfly Snuka \ A legend or murderer \ escapes the steel cage.
"Bamboo leaves in snow \ Make a bad haiku for fun \ It's Sunday, who cares"
Haikus don't like you \ They don't like anything though \ They're inanimate
Without prejudice \ the sun shines its golden rays \ on all her children
a half inch of haste \ paw prints in the sodden grass \ slowly fill with rain
hamster wheels spin on \ just like the last time they did \ tired repetition
"Subway smells, sullen \ or sharp, does ebb and flow with \ each shuffle and stop."
six jets in a v \ strings of a guitar plucked softly \ the vast space of sky
On the horizon \ The earth and sky swap places \ then fade into black
Staring at a screen \ I think I'm losing my mind \ Better check Facebook
Blown iPhone speakers \ Peel like bells in my ears \ Dead petals falling
A crack in the sky \ the silhouette of dead trees \ contrast the bright moon
"dog, pig, cow, chicken, \ every sentient thing is \ an 'I' to themselves."
had my misgivings \ gay anal for a living \ but it pays alright
...of an endless loop \ thoughts irreconcilable \ slick with the motion...
Yes daddy I want \ that sticky juicy cum in \ my asshole right now
"Exhausted raindrops. \ She is waiting for bed-time. \ MORE STORIES , he yells."
This is a story \ where the protagonist's love \ is unrequited.
Mistress Moon makes \ her regretful departure \ Master Sun cloaked
"Mistress Moon, Master \ Sun dancing across heaven \ clouds hide modesty"
"Sleepless again. Why \ Each day a yawning chasm. \ A life, unrested."
Not thinking is hard \ easier without a brain \ ...I think this is right
Little soldier boy \ leaves from the vine falling slow \ please come marching home
"She looks down kindly \ from an old, brush-stroked canvas \ summer behind her."
drunk at tattoo shop \ this genital graffiti \ I will soon regret
Mushrooms all about \ Popping up through the damp soil \ Earth's magic buttons
rocks and dried flowers \ the overused window sill \ holds up the garden
Dawn painting frosty \ windscreen a rosey hue \ breath taken away
Master Sun Rising \ Mistress Moon still lingering \ finches tweet gossip
I've always been shy \ Please don't judge. First time posting \ in suicide watch
A blanket of frost \ Commuters are blowing steam \ Stuck in a rush hour.
Our thoughts and our words \ fallen leaves tangled in grass \ puzzle we can't solve
Flushed faces and laughs \ Children dance across fresh snow \ Doodling music.
"Chilly breeze, cold sky \ our eyes meet and our hearts beat \ orange horizons"
couldn't find wallet \ anal with the pizza boy \ lucky he was gay
"Her phone sits, draining \ It's inches from a charger \ It dies anyway"
We realised at that \ very last moment that we \ loved eachother.
Define a haiku \ teach me creativity \ tell me I am wrong
The crest rubs the sky \ throbbing ocean fills valley \ a release of life
"Gross disposition \ meaning well, kind intentions \ but you missed the point"
This lovely river \ Flowing calmly over me \ It leaves me breathless
"please, shut the fuck up \ it's all dog tactics to me \ wheeling and dealing"
Someone is making \ loud eating noises on a \ rush hour subway car
Is this the real life \ Or is this just fantasy \ Caught in a landslide
"A luminous mass-- \ Static, evermoving dots-- \ Formative, Harmful"
haiku one-thousand \ if you return the favor \ i will preserve you
Six inches of snow \ blanketing frozen ground \ ice rain as well. Nice.
Bitterly cold air \ dare I crack open the door \ my shadow frozen

"Just had Indian \ Friday, on my way to work \ I will shit my pants"
"Spark of something new \ Ignites a blaze that burns me \ Stomp, stomp out ashes"
If only I could \ Burn the dress which you wore for \ The world to look through
If only I could \ weave my love into a poem \ and read it to you
i found undisclosed \ terms of endearment in your \ restraining order
A warm winter dawn \ Falls victim to changing winds \ A cold settles in
"lecherous old man \ senile nah, more like penile \ a perfect cover"
"Packed away, quiet \ The herd rest calmly so \ Tomorrow starts new"
Awoke with a start \ I dreamt a beautiful song \ By dawn it is gone
Dab Shatter \ Smoke Marijuana \ Four-Twenty
Writing a haiku \ Stimulating exercise \ A verse emerges
On a sunday eve \ depression sets in again \ Monday morning blues
"steaming offspring dragged \ away, a mother screams so \ you can have dairy."
"Red Bug Slough I hear \ the most sinister kazoo \ Anhinga, that's you."
Magma into ash \ Destroying all in its path \ Volcanoes are cool
A brief encounter \ pretty eyes hard to forget \ maybe she's a dream.
"I have to chuckle, \ I backed into a prison \ of my own making."
The haze of low cloud \ obscuring mountainous peaks \ lightning cracks the sky.
A brass monkeys balls \ It is cold enough outside \ To freeze them right off
I've thrown up in space \ my helmet became opaque \ I'll take it off and
"he walks in, at last \ I don't bother to say hi \ dead hearts are silent"
"the days fade away \ ebb and flow of light and dark \ apathy, my drug"
"Tangled tree branches, \ fine, needle like, greyish brown, \ on a bleak winter sky."
The bird sings to him \ evening sun through prison bars \ his one happiness.
Mountain caps fade white \ A once mighty river crawls \ Bear cubs wade across
dim lit moves like dawn \ high noon mid-air won't fall chess \ pieces warped and strewn
"Oyster and his grain \ of sand, does he cultivate \ art or suffering"
"I sit here, silent \ well, not exactly silent \ the water splashes on toilets"
Unique aroma \ a reminder of your touch \ a scent so divine
ohhh FUCK yes of course \ this weirdness ever present \ lights out just jump in
Fuzzy muppet dick \ yes miss piggy yes please more please \ Kermit's puppet cream
Start of a new year \ Hope it will be much better \ Let's hope for the best
Accidentally \ way too much cream in my pie \ now the deed is done
Studying inside \ A fair wind blows the window \ Refresh my hot head
Fuck me in the ass \ Turn my asshole inside out \ Hepatitis C
Striped shore crabs shuffle \ Ocean waves pummel ashore \ The bulldog gives chase
While Clinton denied \ and Donald boasted with pride \ America cried.

Shit into my mouth \ vomit on everything \ contract E. Coli
as a level three \ I feel an obligation \ to re-offend well
Stillness in the air \ Pierced sunlight shines through blackness \ Dawn awakens
I know a fun sponge \ His home lies under the sea \ It's a pineapple
walk into kitchen \ open and close cupboard doors \ cat cries WAAAA
Brightly colored lights \ heralds of the season \ bitter wind off bay
My heavens sundered \ will I ever fall asleep \ I weap in rain's place
our conversations \ became one person talking \ while everyone shouts
The high times are gone \ nothing seems right anymore \ that's just growing up
I think that my life's \ sole purpose is being a \ cautionary tale.
"A chesterfield sits \ where friends once talked, drank and laughed \ now just furniture"
"Storm wind blowing hard \ branches crashing, trees moaning \ sleepless, dreamless night"
Your lips fooled my own \ thinking they would one day meet \ but they never could.
"as permanent and \ efficacious as autumn frost \ you said, i love you."
Spite towards success \ The sound of perseverance \ Reflects our own flaws
register me as \ level three. almost certain \ to re-offend soon
"Bye 2016 \ This year has been a rough one \ Next year, please be good"
My favorite dude \ from borderlands the second \ was the assassin.

"I've farted outdoors \ yet, I'm smelling it proper \ 'cause no breeze, of course"
winter ticks on slow \ but the songbird does not count \ each cold morning note
It hurts to look back \ I'm afraid to look ahead \ I look at the ground
Walking down the street \ people afraid to look up \ there's so much to see
Just one click away \ I consider it briefly \ but no porn today.

Fragrance of ceder \ pine cones crunching underfoot \ harken back in time
The floods rise unkempt \ There are no chances for hope \ We weather the storm
The rains purify \ The water surges endless \ We are born again

Long gone days of warmth \ Frigid air and a still heart \ ushers in the rain
A warm DVR \ our kitty's favorite spot \ that's where you'll find her.
Worn out business tie \ Grips the neck with growing force \ Hangman's favorite noose
Hillside silver crest \ Sunset nests upon the eaves \ Memories of Spring
Fallen leaves aflame \ From corpses black smoke rises \ True essence revealed

One more failed attempt \ I feel completely hopeless \ I wish I were dead
Wrapped in your embrace \ Darkness slowly consumes me \ I feel so alone

"First, I was afraid. \ Can't live away from your side \ No. I will survive."
My heart's on fi-er \ I know my Elvira's mine \ Oom papa mow mow
Waiting for daybreak \ 25 or 6 to 4 \ I give up Eyes closed
Purple haze surrounds. \ That girl put a spell on me. \ Let me kiss the sky.
Know when to hold 'em \ Know when it's better to fold. \ Thus spake the Gambler.
"Mom, I killed a man \ Put a gun against his head \ Then pulled the trigger"
"Just like a virgin, \ Touched for the very first time. \ Oh who'm I kidding"
Cryin' all the time. \ You're nothing but a hound dog. \ Yain't no friend of mine.
The flash of a blade. \ Someone sneaks 'round the corner. \ Who's there Mack the Knife.
Sweet slumbers embrace \ Counting away the moments \ Too hot for real sleep
Gotta catch them all \ Time to walk around a bit \ So Pokemon go
"Life stops for no one. \ If you re ever in the way, \ it runs you over"
Crazy long day done \ Commute from hell now over \ Relax and just breathe
"To the voice which says \ don't bother, this won't be good \ thank you, now fuck off"
"My feet are too hot \ So I'm working in my socks \ Well, I say working..."
"Dear moon, send my love \ Mediate our sentiments \ Your shine leads me home"
"A dying man dreams \ that his friend will pick him up \ sometime, tomorrow."
A signifier \ only points to other signs \ Everything adrift
"If everything seems \ under control, then you're not \ going fast enough."
in she walks like ice \ routine straight from the text book \ ticking like clockwork
"Long shadows stretched \ clouds, wind, and water flowed \ from mountains tall"
Chainsaw whining high \ tree fibers snapping with strain \ monkey-beaver life.
lonely memories \ and hearts without counterparts \ ruins of love lost
"anything war can \ I fought the war, and war won \ do I do better"
And again it comes \ brought forth by harmless events \ the depressing thought
Fraught appeals conveyed \ in bipolar tones I bleed \ brine and agave.
Stripped from mother's arms \ Born as Red as the eyes that \ Weep over its grave
Regret buying cheap scotch \ Tried to fix with club soda \ failed even more
I wish I could sleep \ like a bear every winter \ dream my life away
"Eight minutes time, and \ ninety million lonely miles \ becomes my shadow."
"Your love was a storm \ feral electricity \ and now, petrichor."
Three hundred CP \ One shot caught this Bulbasaur \ Now the game has crashed
Now the summer sun \ Warms the busy cycle lane \ A puncture happens
Today will drag \ Tomorrow will arrive soon \ Yesterday is past
getting excited \ don't want to spoil this moment \ by saying too much
I cannot deny \ other brothers cannot lie \ small waist round thing
The perfect haiku \ Magnificence splendour \ My anathema
Vodka whiskey rum \ Drink it all straight down in one \ Tomorrows will hurt
"Black velvet blanket-- \ light seeps through your holes, poked by \ a sickle of gold"
Sunshine warms my soul \ Cocktails and suncream abound \ What to wear tonight
We carry the weight \ of those who came before us \ for that i'm sorry
Do you not realize \ The monsters you fear most were \ made by you alone
Purest of flowers \ Delicate beyond compare \ Thorns hidden ready
Your wide lipped smile \ Glows like a thousand candles \ Your frown blows them out
"Goodbye scaredy cat \ For you, green fields where the Sun \ is always shining"
Giraffes will gyrate \ Genteelly they're gesturing \ Gif is how it's said
People are bound to \ disappoint. Even Satan \ was God s favourite
"Looking at your face, \ I clench my stomach and pray \ that lunch stays down there"
Secret to haiku \ Just add huh to short lines huh \ Mention Mount Fuji
Picking for berries \ All around the distant fields \ Forgot the basket
"But I, being poor \ Have only my dreams. So I \ lay them at your feet"
I look to my right \ then I look to my left \ Then I cross the street
Tried my first haiku \ Please give a little advice \ Thank you very much
Little fish swimming \ Going about their business \ Blissful ignorance
Travelling the world \ Always doing the same thing \ Should have stayed at home
The wind does not know \ Life and death and life again \ The wind will still blow
crooked hillary \ puts mayo on pastrami \ it's a schmear campaign
Squirrel shakes a branch. \ Artificial rain on me. \ A refreshing run. run
The autumn leaves fall \ Every year without ceasing \ where do they all go
A heavy first touch \ The taste of dirt and cool grass \ Possession restored.
I smile less and go \ out more to things with no cause \ Semper Fi goodbye son
To pour gasoline \ on a country--a body \ dripping with sorrow
we have mean dogs here \ i don't worry anymore \ it's the chance i take
A cool breeze recalls \ a time before the summer \ and bodes the winter.
Your shirt may cost like \ 800 but we both still \ got the same sweat stains.

"let it live, pulsate \ rhythmic patterns beyond us \ infinite, the all"
"slow and way down where \ yeah, that's almost perfection \ ohhhh variation"
"O, my friend You are \ always close by, and yet we \ have become distant"
Your smile is the gate \ Which opens the path to reach \ Your passionate love
waiting for the close \ of day to wear down to just \ obliteration
"I caught a glimpse of \ myself in a passing bus, \ then I turned away."
"Steak I tell the man \ He scoops a pitiful spoon \ Give me more, darn it"
Each generation \ fears it will see the world end. \ It'd be an honor.
"In this world I seek \ A place where I belong, it \ Is not that easy"
"Eventually, \ variable rewards lead \ to learned helplessness"
"It's cold in the shade \ Let's travel, into the Sun \ Feel the warmth within"
"Silence kills us both \ Your voice halts this murderer \ Save us, please speak up"
it's all that and this \ and then it's all that and this \ who actually cares
Waiting for my wife \ The story of my life \ Whiskey has time for me
I've had lucky breaks \ and broken hearts - but never \ lucky broken hearts
Only have one wish \ When it comes to missing you \ Annul this sadness
"He says he needs space \ I turn away, don't look back \ His heart grows fonder."
Softest fur stone cold \ A stray cat hit by a car \ Abandoned again.
Waiting to go home \ Time moves slower than fathomed \ Life can be unfair.
Outcomes uncertain \ With impeccability \ Breathe and get started

mosquito bit me \ i see you little monster \ blood stain on the wall
"Oh this summer heat \ Unending, unforgiving \ thunder storms abound"
Bloated and swollen \ Now unrecognisable \ Death by committee
"Spring is upon us \ New life, a new beginning \ Its a time of change"
"Grassy base, snow top \ Mountain trails open \ Foot traffic scare deer"
The rays of the sun \ Distant call of the koveli \ Night resides in me
Churning in silence \ Burning with hateful violence \ Yearning for guidance
Monday lacks something \ I think it might be an a \ Between n and o
"This is what they do \ They always leave a note, huh \ 'til worlds meet again"
We are the misfits \ And our songs are much better \ We are the misfits
Onward to battle \ A battle of emotions \ The heart is weakest
Dark and stormy days \ Temporary misery \ The sun shines beyond
Floating in the pool \ Naked under the night sky \ Beauty all around
Never good enough \ Emotional self-abuse \ This is depression
My truth like water \ Flows through the cracks in your lies \ Discovers its shape
How many toll booths \ Does one have to throw change at \ To have been somewhere
That s one thing about \ People they re so messy once \ You open them up.
ah shit man.... AGAIN \ just hang on to that money \ bargains are lifes gifts
One more year slips by \ Like a well-aimed hockey puck \ The goalie laments
"Nobody makes nice \ manhole covers anymore, \ I thought to myself."
Flash and machine whirr \ Copy after copy prints \ They are all the same
A breeze though the trees \ Like leaves falling in autumn \ Beautiful it is
Inside of my head \ Even friends abandon me \ Anxiety sucks
Even a mirror \ Will not reflect your true self \ If you will not see
The wind in your hair \ Chilling bites upon your skin \ The joys of winter
"days without sunshine \ Are what we usually call \ nights , as you might know"
"So thoughtful at night \ whilst the boring sleep, he \ marvels, he wonders"
"Dreaming i'm back home \ Consciousness, please don't take me \ I'm so happy here."
"I must leave you, drugs \ Easy cash and hard pain dance \ Death comes fast or slow"
Constantly being \ painfully reminded of those times \ how it used to be
I am so so tired \ I leaped off the ledge falling \ from the sky near death
One hard caliber \ Six revolving chambers wait \ My turn just came up
Hey ya'll look at me \ hold my beer while I do this \ funeral soon follows
"I. In the internment \ camp, notes passed, translated to \ five-seven-five killed."
A leaden drop clings \ Fire seethes for flesh to love \ Ripples impending
"Dark, distant rumblings \ A gust of wind and on it \ comes the smell of rain"
Doors all around me \ on each wall won't open Why \ CAUSE THEY'RE REAL FAKE DOORS
"Behind a closed door \ things happen, but I can't look \ and neither can you."
Plummeting from sky \ we observe as you ignite \ meteor shower.
The journey began \ as seeking ended the earth \ filled him with wonder
"Middle of the week \ worn, tired but still enthused \ same as all weeks past"
"The benighted moth \ and I, share a common fate \ drawn towards your flame."
"Shadow swirls, constricts \ Gasping, flailing, straining, blind \ praying for the light"
There is no way out \ I cannot escape the grasp \ I love her too much
"Briefly escaping \ Brahman, two parabolas \ asymptotic warmth"
"The bridge was breaking \ On both sides, he stood smiling \ for his wings grew back"
"Another cup now, \ drink your 1000 moods in \ handfuls of tea leaves."
He felt a fire rise \ From the deep void he couldn't close \ Explosion of joy
from some dream afar \ got that thing that's... just that thing \ loves infinite grace
"Jade-laden throne rooms, \ adorned with scenes of splendor \ dynastic tombs rot."
"The chipmunk the cat \ killed, family too--The monk \ who said Bah, let's drink"
"Soup needs bread to dunk \ Fingers crossed, check the bread bin \ Only end slices"
"No one is watching, \ two fingers and ten minutes, \ and no one noticed."
"you fly, I follow \ lost in your tumbling embrace \ the name of the wind"
There it was \ My sleep \ Lying on mother's lap
I am a cashier \ Not your bitch you piece of shit \ Unload your basket
Bacchus' loose conduct \ Mercury's chicanery \ And Mars' hot temper
tempest her rhythm \ echoes of a dark song \ a story in silence
"My motivation, \ Is out there somewhere, waiting. \ Why can t I find you"
"5 dogs break silence \ 5 dogs bark Wake up, Walk me, \ 5 dogs burn my brain"
I prefer hamsters \ They bite when they don't want you \ And run in circles
Scorpion waits still \ Cricket jumps and triggers hairs \ Barb gives life and death
I died last July \ Ice cream melting on my corpse \ Best summer ever
"sometimes, when i see \ my shadow, i think about \ how evil i am"
Mother unfurled steam \ She saw men fornicating \ Her son curled in tears.
Hug when I'm weeping \ Or the monsters are creeping. \ Or just to sleep in
"Time, stop this motion. \ If I can't have perfection, \ give me stagnation."
Your heart is a bird \ all the world is a cage \ only love will open
"When I was deadwood \ The wave came over me so fierce \ Now, I am driftwood"
We couldn't fill it \ There's less than I remember. \ Guess it's better that way.
You adorn yourself \ With divinity and I shall \ Call myself pious
"Months it has taken. \ Peace, at last, we have found it \ pushing up daisies."
"Her tears fell on the \ third rail and shut down New York, \ it wasn't her fault."
all the more stupid \ the tale of the butterfly \ who clipped her own wings
Rocks underwater \ can't hide because they still make \ waves on the surface.
The harsh wind whispers. \ It's vehemence muffled. \ Your heart out of reach.
On the cusp again \ Crossroads of life approaching \ Which path will I choose
"Where did you go, love \ I asked ten bottles. Silence. \ I'll just ask ten more."
guess it's times like these \ she's more than a pretty face \ the repetition
Through the syntax I see \ Operations that vex me \ Let's start refactoring thee
A smoker coughing \ The cricket chirping outside \ As a chair reclines
Programming falters \ Memories come flooding back \ He lowers his gun
Does uncertainty \ devour all at age thirty \ or am I unique
The sand on the beach \ Churned-up by small children's feet \ sand castle dreaming
"Moving out the house \ Paying taxes, buying milk \ A mother in tears."
Not drinking too much \ That or drinking too little \ Don't tell my doctor
"575 Do not speak your wish \ Before the shimmering snow \ Space-rock, Hadouken"
If I could see you \ Half awake and almost dead \ I'd cherish the zed
what are emotions \ i feel like i'm a robot \ slowly breaking down
"Prancing in the rain. \ We splash in puddles, laughing. \ You are my best friend."
I came into the world \ knowing I'd be gone in a \ breath and still I danced.
"What chance did we have \ When yours is a heart of fire \ and mine, ashen stone."

This is a haiku \ I love to make them a lot \ They are very fun.
The rain continues \ Pitter patter on the grass \ Baseball is delayed

Friends with benefits \ Eating the last known bison \ Insatiable bloodlust
Ripples in the pond \ The blue heron strikes quickly \ Golden orfe scatter

Exploring this world \ not all who wander are lost. \ Nice to meet you too.
"Bitter winds echo \ With the moonless night lit bright. \ I, indelible."
"You've been amazing. \ From the beginning, in fact. \ But then you forgot."
Laying in my bed \ Mexican music is loud \ Will it ever stop
The grey curtains fall \ Still drunk on dry summer days \ Pleasant petrichor
"amidst probing eyes \ she flaunts the skin her face, a mask \ bills like fallen leaves"
"Solving a puzzle \ only to find, in the end \ A piece was missing"
Look up and away \ No-where to go but uphill \ Dread the future's trek
Is there ever a \ discussion about haiku \ format conventions
Walked barefoot outside \ Not paying much attention \ I stepped on a snail...
Scars are just the signs \ Of the past failures through which \ You have persevered
shaking like a leaf \ falling backwards like thunder \ reversed and rehearsed
He's alone in this \ Couples talking as they pay \ Maybe tomorrow
Prematurely bald \ relinquish last of beauty \ savings on shampoo
first match on Tinder \ one polite message to her \ soz meant to swipe left
A dusty wardrobe \ full of worn out boots and coats \ and dead ambitions.
nigh apocalypse \ good thing I saved the baby \ that's some good eatin'
a seedy motel \ the wall bends with the banging \ the beast with two backs
"don't give in, push on \ raise banner high, cry BATTLE \ who do i fight for"
when I cry at work \ the other clowns take notice \ and grin nervously
"And on the third day \ God said Let there be light \ Lamps were made, God left"
"Sitting, pondering \ socks are unnecessary. \ profound I hope not."
reach deep down inside \ produce one gory organ \ to skid in the pan
"This beauty warms me \ bathing in the radiance. \ Salutations, Sun."
my heart skips a beat \ a mouse rattling the rib cage \ begging for release
"A grand tree plummets \ cacophonous crash ensues \ Yes, I hear a sound"
even if you won \ when the fighting is over \ you must still submit
never boil a rock \ it could have an air pocket \ that makes it explode
I'm in a good mood \ Tappin' my feet to a song \ Hummin' in my mind
Curiosity \ Did it really kill the cat \ It has eight more lives.
Audacious Hope my \ callipygian consort \ lost I'm without you
Things collecting dust \ Are the only stuff I've got \ In this prison called now
A soft little child \ Fought a wolf in wintry lands \ Came back as their king.
Sap tree's blood sticky \ Sadness belongs to people \ People feel feelings
I cheated on her \ in the summer of our youth. \ We've reunited
More fish in the sea \ Such a shame. She was your sea \ my mind says to me.
"Why you saps so sad \ Write about something happy \ trampolines, Perhaps."
"Dear sweet, fleeting, love \ perhaps we could meet again \ in another time."
Drunk on rotten fruit \ Stag stumbles through the mountains \ and meets some pink Hens
Languid summer days \ in lazy garden shadows \ relax and dissolve
"Oh, to be the wind \ Who, alone, holds the pleasure \ Of tussling your hair"
Melting snow on roof \ Is my soul as white as you -- \ Or street slush to sluice
"A rumbling hunger \ aching to feast on bounty. \ Oh, no, flatulence."
My head is pounding \ Dark thoughts chase away the light \ The black dog is here
My beautiful cat \ Please stop your incessant meows. \ It's barely past dawn.
"Sunshine and the beach \ Sand, sea and children's laughter \ Summer just a dream"
"Haiku and running \ Clutter, cleanse mind and body \ Breathless syllables"
a lid lifts slowly \ revealing the glowing eyes \ of a vampire
Life is so fleeting \ Like a daffodil in spring \ Radiant then gone
Forum to forum \ The internet fishing troll \ It's time to fight back
Don't be paranoid \ but please keep an eye out for \ unattended bags
Fire in the brush \ Rabbit gets a promotion \ Are you hungry yet
if you knew the truth \ and what happens around you \ you'd be scared shitless
Hemp and beads laid out \ Inspiration in the air \ Knotting underway
"Pitter-patter boom \ Lights flickering in my room \ Thunder, lightning, doom"
"there were countless nights \ of being with, to now be \ suddenly without"
once I soiled my pants \ skiing down beginner's slope \ still I am humble
When I was little \ I used to think I could fly \ Reality hit
fear's a reminder \ of how far acceptance is \ from understanding
"Laughter, giggles, smiles \ children playing soothes my soul. \ Yet, a child I am."
melancholy mood \ jazz wafting through subway air \ I dance with myself
"Welcome to Monday \ living for another week. \ rinse, lather, repeat."
Waking up slowly \ I sleep until the dog barks \ Then I write Haiku
Good Mexican Food \ My farts are filling the air \ Chile Rellenos
kissed by sunlight \ your smile makes me happy \ as the sun sets.
Crystallization \ A platinum straw goddess \ Hollow ecstacy
the wind does my hair \ it does a pretty shit job \ but it's free of charge
i remain hollow \ you visit me in my dreams \ and leave me empty
there is no room for \ ulcerative colitis \ yet it fits line two
"Doctor's waiting room \ empty now except for me \ two hours, still waiting"
A dimly lit room \ the weary crowd issues groans \ while Zack Snyder dines
a pristine toilet \ a man's reluctant bowels \ a stray pube mocking
"Black, strong and bitter \ Anticipating the rush \ that may hit too hard."
Staring back at me \ No hint of recognition \ All fish are stupid
Moon shows the wolf's dance \ it's muzzle towards the sky \ Howls the ancient trance
"I resented you \ I blinked, and you slipped away \ I miss you so much"
"eternal toad lives \ to forever and beyond \ afterward, he croaks"
"A tree stump, a seat \ A place to rest tired feet. \ Gift from Mother Oak."
"In biology, \ We did eye dissection. It \ Was eye opening"
The sly hummingbird \ Teasing as it darts about \ Ever out of reach
Hilarious joke \ A chicken crosses a road. \ Got hit by a truck.
Wasted away life. \ Sitting at a computer. \ Shame to say it's me.
"Meandering by, \ we watch the lazy river. \ We wasted it time."
Available tools \ Finding a good use for them \ difficult can be.
Kangaroos are fat \ who are they stompin around \ like they own the place
No more dislodged tiles \ replaced with linoleum \ things are looking up
"White, blue, deep scarlet \ I see the red grow, flooding \ Drowning our eagle"
Like an icicle \ slowly melting inside me \ I shiver in bed
Jack shone bloody light \ On White Chapel s misery \ Autumn of Terror
She made an excuse \ and flew from her gilded cage. \ My secret lover.
Staring and staring \ my pen frozen mid-sentence \ Eyes open mind closed
A few days ago \ I tried to remember it \ Instead I forgot
"Cackling, giggling, mad \ Our post copulating ritual \ Our perfect temperature"
A broken mirror \ Depicting my inner self \ Cracked yet functional
Limited beauty \ Art forever restrained by \ A handful of words
"I am what I am \ I am no more, yet no less \ I am what I am"
"Worn path by the street \ tattered shoes, shuffling feet. \ Can you spare some change"
The meaning of life \ I always knew what it was \ Sadly I lost her
Haiku reposted \ It was an honest mistake \ Duplicate is down
Michigan springtime \ Confused robins listening \ For worms under snow
"Spring. Showers sideways \ A Doe shelters in my yard \ from the cold, North wind."
Dead but still breathing \ There's no cure for inner cold \ A breathing tombstone
She's married to him \ but her heart belongs to me. \ It's complicated.
"I should really stop \ writing hai...ku... Ah, dang it... \ I did it again..."
How is it that I \ can heal the wounds of others \ but never my own
Yin and Yang wiper \ Sun s rays warming cold windows \ Bounding white-flagged deer
My desires take flight \ because I don't understand \ how much they can hurt.
"Psilotum nudum, \ Banana cream allusion, \ Cretan brake, cycad."
Tears roll down my skin \ let yourself fall into me \ the tears are not mine
"April showers bring \ May flowers make the birds sing \ Welcome, welcome spring"
Tangled in the sheets \ Fingers sticky with desire \ I can taste your love
I would not be on \ My best behavior with you \ In movie darkness
"Sing me to sleep. No \ matter how off key you are, \ your voice still soothes me."
A dot in the sky \ a titan of flaming rage \ what am i to them
"I will wait for you \ Be it a thousand summers \ or, for forever."
"Filling up with hope \ the chrysalis protects my dreams. \ Oh flames, be gentle."
I'm falling \ And I'm terrified \ I should hide
I love you \ And not even fear \ Will change that
A church bell chimes twice- \ My eyes close as the sound fades \ And I dream of you.
After a few beers \ I'm a bit free and hazy \ I fear tomorrow
"no one in this sub \ thought to drop a line, or two \ dreams are coming true"
They say they will die for you \ But I live for you \ Every-single day
The only time I've \ Ever said I love you was \ In a text message
"I am new to this \ Please up vote me, I'm desperate \ Thank you OK Bye"
This is a haiku \ This has seven syllables \ Self-Explanation
Limited only \ By our imaginations \ And phone batteries
Crawling in my Skin \ These wounds they will not he-al \ Fear is how I Fall.

how could this happen \ my heart lies broken again \ why won't you have me
"Happiness for sale, \ if you can find it. \ Collection only"
Rain on Saturday \ Drips of melancholia \ Fucks up my weekend
Please just let me go \ I am tired of being trapped \ Bed you're so comfy
When fear arises \ Tranquility s clarity \ And vision distort
a tiny satellite \ caught in your orbit briefly \ two misaligned paths
Your eyes open and \ close rapidly heart beat mind \ wanders missing you
"Simple bets for fun \ oh, how my chest boast outwards \ it's mine, victory"
missing you today \ I wonder if you'll read this \ do you think of me
At night after work \ surrounded by mosquitoes \ taking down damp clothes.
"Sadness consumes me \ Hello, darkness, my old friend \ I drink my feelings"

Inexplicable \ How I can be contented \ Yet want so much more
Alone in the dark. \ Above sheets under the fan. \ A plane's fading growl.
"Old, used teddy bear, \ He waits for tea time to play. \ Tea time never comes."
"Sirens wail steel hail \ Mankind's last great fireworks show \ Ground shakes, shock hits - peace"
Piss Flaps Slapping Sound \ Girlfriend Walks Around The Room \ Put Some Clothes On Bitch
No wound fully heals \ ripping off a band-aid \ still leaves a residue

It feels long ago \ our one path was forced in two. \ Tell me your stories
"Describe one person \ you saw on the train today. \ Now, why that person"
"being with you is \ not falling once, but falling \ over and over."
"It hurts to see your \ lips unkissed, your eyes unmet, \ and your soul unmissed"
A profound statement \ That one doesn't understand. \ We'll stand together.
Pooping is my state \ My legs are becoming numb \ hoping to wipe soon
You didn't need to \ say Excuse me your perfume \ announced your intent.
That growing grin \ fleeting hopeful spark in Girls \ HBO's pure gold
Smell of hot wet earth \ freedom in doing nothing \ a drunken ride home
Sometimes life can throw \ Everything at you at once \ fight fight fight fight fight
Open the macbook \ long searching for life s answers \ but they're all outside
molecular sight \ another dimension waits \ is it truly god
Only tourists flinch \ when the express train passes \ New York shibboleth.
inevitable \ these concepts that contradict \ forever is NOW
Guns are in control \ they feed you fear in masses \ That is gun control
Trying a haiku \ To engage my wordsmithing \ Seems to lack something
you follow the rules \ but one day you'll have to fight \ and you won't know how
"i suck at my job \ but try to be successful \ oh, futility."
Highway directions \ the first stretch of damp new wings \ to eat with mountains
Christmas is over \ Johnny-come-lately white stuff \ Cold apologies
If I had one wish \ For anything in the world \ I'd waste it on you.
"China, they love me \ Build a wall by the border \ Fuck the Mexicans"
pink tube gets so warm \ put it on there and fuck me \ made it powerful
smoulders just for her \ since day one magnetic heat \ stay with me for life
Multiple Eyes Watch \ Always looking for Danger \ Will I keep them Safe
Warm bikinied skin \ our candles replace the stars \ cigarettes on Ping
swift grooves growing lines \ though this garden I've once grown \ old lot still brings life
Envy on the wind \ Fast it burns but slow do I \ And so I smolder.
"88 days left \ until he leaves the building. \ My love, please don t go."
black cacophony \ you are my sunshine somehow \ yeah just uninspired
Cool beer in the shade \ market scent of strange delights \ rats searching for food
We miss you dearly \ Many memories in tow \ With love binding them.
Eyes watch from the roof \ two wheeled view of all the earth \ lost in Chinatown
"Today, tomorrow \ I drown my life of sorrows \ Green spirit of pain"
It's quite sad really \ Who you wanted me to be \ Is now who I am
Gasoline engine \ weaving through bustling crowds \ hair blowing in wind
"I can t feel my face \ When I m with you. Oh god, help \ I m having a stroke"
We are not human \ It's not our place to judge them \ Wonder why you do
Heavy burden's ache \ roadside wait to rest the legs \ barking down alleys
sometimes I just go \ and lie to my ex girlfriends \ it makes me happy
I give my last coin \ to an old scar-cheeked stripper \ what have I to lose
Drunken honesty \ no stomach for more Pad Thais \ thirteen long hours north
"To touch of death we \ must surrender, for time is \ a fickle master"
"1984 \ In the land of the deceased, \ Living men are king"
Fresh fruit of morning \ Is seediness just a myth \ Evening disappoints
mind split soul fragmented \ generic jigsaw pieces \ endless possibilities
End of turbulence \ Tourists flutter moths to flame \ Jet lag nausea
"I raise my first cup \ of coffee. It is dark and \ soon, it is dark out."
"Sweaty palm held tight \ drifting on clouds, miles above \ looking from heaven"
stars collide \ solar systems destroyed \ universes born
Three alarms at five \ Lifted me up this morning \ I groaned and thought twice
Your hot spicy meat \ Give your meat a good old rub \ Then shout Hey yeah Boi
Bathroom fan humming \ I forgot how much it smells \ No smoking allowed
I didn't win or lose \ left with nothing but regret \ time passed still feel it
Why did I not ask \ I was nervous and afraid \ to ruin nothing
Committed my time \ chasing after you only \ to be used by you
Your mind is brilliant \ It's what I wanted the most \ Our bodies in the way
The river runs quick \ A pebble makes no ripple \ Wake up. Wake up. Wake
"The package arrives, \ worrisome tinkling within, \ side reads dn pu s"
...haiku that ne'er ends. \ It goes on and on my friends. \ Keep on reading the...
Challenged by a ghost \ Only perfection allowed \ Frustrating myself
"I heard in New York \ They serve cicada flavored gin \ Hum, motherfuckers"
"Card arrived today \ you said, happy birthday, son. \ but where have you been"
CHD Aware \ My niece is a heart warrior \ 1 in 100
Thought purgatory \ when sheep are without number \ And dawn is coming
I can't see your face \ Can't remember how to smile \ Death did that to me
"Haikus that I wrote \ today while sitting within \ the courthouse, jury trial."
"You guessed it, I'm drunk \ Its got to be 5 somewhere \ Time for another."
The world suffering \ demons riding on shoulders \ always there is hope.
twenty-four dollars \ my pathetic life savings \ is spent on shampoo
"Coldplay was a bore \ Bey dropped-popped, almost fell down \ Bruno can't lip-sync"
Imagination \ She opens up to reveal \ Personality
Today I watched porn \ My girlfriend was next to me \ I had earbuds on
Sometimes I shut down \ facebook just in time before \ I say something bad
I'm so lonely here \ Can't wait till I have someone \ It hurts more each day
Pleasures oft o'erlooked \ Can help fill a yearning heart \ In the interim.
"Someone, as a joke \ bought me a bunch of butt plugs \ it's a long story"
all she said and did \ just one thing i didn't love \ not saying goodbye
"I take my mask off \ In the safety of my room \ My true, hollow self."
She loves him truly \ I cannot tell if I'm loved \ Set one of us free
There s a reason why \ Hurricanes have names. You left \ me devastated
a warm cup of tea \ soft hum of morning rain \ two dimples appear
If a basic girl \ Goes out without taking pics \ Did she really go
shallow rain puddle \ quickly evaporating \ a frog lays her eggs
The air is cold now. \ The birds leave for the season. \ Do they miss their home
Lost in space-time now \ save me wondrous lord. Your name \ Neil deGrasse-Tyson.
breathless twitchy drowning \ pulled into a stomach pit \ folding inwards still
wrote you a letter \ like you have always asked me \ don't know your address
Silent rage within. \ Forgive Not an option now. \ Move forward in peace.
"Face, up towards sky \ Blades of grass waltz with the wind \ Eyes close peacefully"
did you mean those words \ from your drunken mind and mouth \ you're the one slips out
His smile lights the room \ Like the sun shines in summer \ It brightens the world. -Nicole Beers
My eyes are closing \ Falling asleep at the wheel \ Asking for advice
I saw a robin \ Middle of January \ Is this really Spring
Obscured in dark pond \ My foot thinks its a stone fish \ But it's just a rock
I've been in the cupboard too long \ I've passed my best-by date \ throw me out
I'm worthless \ I fail everything \ I can't even write a haiku
"A remark I caught \ Like a virus, infecting \ Eyebrows show distaste"
Scattered snow steaming \ Shimmering sunlight showing \ The grass growing green
I wrap my towel \ around my drying feelings \ I am brave today
got under my skin \ hypodermic syringes \ have nothing on you
Hitler is happy \ Hitler is sadness from Jew \ so gas chamber
I am nobody \ Learning to be no one \ Achieved anything yet
Draped across my lawn \ A tree's shadow in the snow \ Shrouded as clouds shift
Heart overflowing \ In the flash of an instant \ The mouse got the cheese
a blackout of hope \ every break is agony \ x-files come back please
Cool stream runs by rocks \ moss covers over pebbles \ the tall tree is bare
Cold wind strikes my face \ Darkness seeps into my mind \ Without her I'm lost.
She said this to me \ I can not give you the world \ But I just want her
It's slow here at work \ Trying to pay attention \ Chose reddit instead.
The patter of rain \ And ticking clocks all around \ My sleepless evening
Clothes from yesterday \ We exchange a knowing glance \ Why are there no cabs
Sometimes when I'm bored \ I just kick back and haiku \ I've always liked it
Just finished Mistborn \ Strong female protagonist \ Wax and Wayne are next
I wrote a haiku \ this is not that haiku though \ that one is better
Opportunity \ Often leading us towards \ A disappointment
It is easy to \ Throw together a haiku \ Right out of the blue.
Twenty miles we went \ Happy and hedonistic \ I anually reserve 44
Nothing fazes me \ Nothing in particular \ Why does it matter
Termites gnaw my flesh \ In silence they continue \ Leaving emptiness
"Cathartic painting \ We quaffed, we drew in charcoal \ Warm fingerprints left"
writing code at noon \ so many bugs to remove \ where is the daylight
Whenever I m sad \ I proceed to cut myself \ A big piece of cake
We aim for the sky \ The earth beckons us to fall \ Terra cannot win
How often I think \ Of you manic and gorgeous \ Time is not enough
the crack in my mask \ careful of what you might see \ it frightens me too
adept at most things \ he rarely hits a deadline \ adulthood eludes him
Alone once again \ Gentle rain patters tonight \ Waiting for the dawn
"Here we are all just \ Domestic psychopaths, well \ That's how I see us"
"I have a wife now. \ Focus, I can't make a mistake \ for I is now we."
Put thoughts into words \ the feelings into actions \ so the dread can leave
Nose is watering \ The wind blows through my sweatshirt \ Snow is coming soon
Punching bedroom walls \ I too have experienced \ This holy haiku
I woke up today \ so much snow outside the house \ back to the bed now
"I love Skeletons \ That is a sad and weird truth \ Fuck you, Toby Fox."
"Rage when my fist struck. \ Shame has remained in me since, \ Precious bedroom wall."
Cannot sleep tonight \ Fucking around on Reddit \ Making a haiku
This is a haiku \ Dedicated to punk rock \ Fuck the rules
"It's only a knot \ What's so hard about keeping \ Things together, huh"
just second hand thoughts. \ I'm all for recycling but \ this content is thin
"I count 1, 2, 3, \ 4, 5, 6 down the stairwell. \ If I stop, I'll die."
embers glowing red \ the last wisps of smoke rise up \ to meet bare branches
I held you so close \ Advancing my lips to yours \ Yet another dream
our heroes are dying \ carbon life forms returning \ to bond once again
"Dawn, breaking the night \ Scent of bacon, eggs, coffee \ Yay Time for breakfast"
"We battle demons \ Everyday, yet the toughest \ Lives between our ears"
my autocorrect \ will correct autocorrect \ to auto erect
Latches and layers \ Think I've got your algorithm \ Chemical elapse
It s weird that word weird \ Has less syllables than its \ letter w
is there a starman \ i move the stars for no one \ as the world falls down
It was exciting \ Walking around all naked \ Not it is just cold
Why did it feel that \ I had known you forever \ When we met last night
Black cat with white paws \ Falling asleep on the couch \ You seem to seek peace.
There's a beauty in \ The way you fold your clothes \ Or I'm just in love
"For a moment, hope \ Greener pastures lay ahead \ Hidden by the moon"
When that hotline bling \ That can only mean one thing \ Holy shit food's here
Even bad souffles \ Are sugar and egg piles \ Always delightful
Predatory cat \ Toying with a helpless mouse \ She toys with my heart
The orange jungle \ Abandoning all caution \ Run towards the flames
not sure I can be \ equal to code poetry \ my mind's waning phase
a squirrel chitters \ pursued between sabal palms \ by his big brother
Another lap done \ What have we learned so far \ This is exhausting ....
Oh Pomegranate \ So many seeds within you \ Fruit grenade in me
Elusive slumber \ A fox creeps in the forest \ The hunter persists
Oh Pomegranate \ Your blood is on my plain knife \ And my fingers stick.
Oh Pomegranate \ You're so messy and so sweet \ You are good for me.
Calendar on wall \ Still set to October third \ When I last held mom
Haiku from Japan \ Are not like those from Russia \ Where poem writes you
And sometimes I jog \ Other days I stay in bed \ Trying to forget
Maybe I should be \ More social this time around \ I'm joking of course
"Half asleep, conscious \ Immobile, grab my laptop \ Right where I left off"
My mom likes to yell \ I hug her when I can't write \ Her laugh warms my soul
"Oak, with matching stools \ Quiet, simple ambience \ Brandy old-fashioned"
Friendless and alone \ I feel more confident now \ but having less fun
"Orbiting this Earth \ A planet full of people \ And yet, I'm alone"
Blanket-less nude grass \ Your internal clocks disturbed \ Spring in December
Only when I make \ A mark upon this world shall \ I debate to leave
"Sunset barbecue \ Music fills the evening air \ Steaks, burgers, for all"
"Flu on Christmas night \ The smells combat in my room \ Ginger, pine, vomit"
I wanna eat cake \ Yet there is none to be found \ Refrigerator
old couple in love \ faces with deep folds in skin \ heart has no wrinkles
"Sprinkle Girl on D \ Careful tho, the fairies bite \ Might be kinda Hawt..."
"They say what goes up \ Always has to come back down \ So I sit, and wait."
Still floating confused \ honest opposes loving \ which do I decide
"Lifes fate, carved in stone \ Tortured by the choices made \ Glum until the void"
Gazing at the stars \ Darkness washes over me \ The pain never ends
A wicked raven \ floats outside a prison wall \ mocking those within
there is a fine line \ between a glance and a gaze \ you made me cross it
Unforgiving Sun \ Washes away the darkness \ Freedom is at hand
Silence permeates \ Whirlpool in the black ocean \ Irresistible
"In the dry desert, \ even the dirty water \ can quench a man's thirst."
I'm no one special \ I'm just an artsy asshole \ Writing pretty words
The jolly fat man \ Laughing at my solitude \ The forest is still
"Merriment in cold, \ brought by wishes of joy so \ sing Merry Christmas"
Fight a horse-sized duck \ With its ballistic penis \ Want to choose again
Mother's dementia \ if memories are shadows \ best not waste the light.
"Leaves are but a dress \ A dress in a ball, Only \ there to make it more"
Muffled footsteps \ The ticking clock echoing \ A familiar sigh
"The wind entertains \ with both song and dance,the sun \ warms,the chair comforts"
Rain in December \ The snowmen have gone missing \ Where s my white Christmas
visions of beyond \ trickle into the mind's eye \ a true spectacle
Snowless winter days \ Purposelessly existing \ The darkness pollutes

the mathematician \ plotting his past relations \ 'ex' and 'why' axis
Memories abound \ Made myself an island but \ Forgot you're the sea
I thought of her as \ Mountains must think of the sky \ Relentless torture.
"In search of gold now \ only to find the downvotes \ keep calm, reddit on."
Faces imploded \ Emulsified and consumed \ By a pack of nuns
Fire in the hearth \ Snow lies thick upon the ground \ Earl Grey tea in hand
Holidays haunt me \ Reminders of love long lost \ Memories frozen
In my solitude \ The stillness of the ocean \ Calmly deceiving
"Evergreen stands tall \ Amidst snow and frozen lake \ One day, it will fall."
an abstract riddle \ where is the elevator \ empty glass. half fool.
My life is a song \ my heart is the instrument \ you're the musician
Trembling oak boughs bend \ Road blocked by fallen branches \ Bowed but unbroken
little black dress \ crumpled on the bedroom floor \ price tag still attached
When you have children \ you want to live forever \ until you lose them
Tijuana bar \ I order another round \ her assertive mewl
To become yourself \ One must overcome the fear \ of knowing yourself.
Little Chickadees \ Not well hidden among the \ Branches of Winter
the heart fickle thing \ why won't it listen to me \ loneliness persists
A Glimpse of the sun \ sunlight surrounds my being \ night returns quickly
Loneliness echoes \ Dreams of her yearn and beckon \ This limbless pillow
"Red trees cloud the sky \ Women crying, Crimson Child \ It will never end."
First date in a while \ Forgot the kiss at the end \ Dam you asbergers
Affection warms me \ the fire is extinguished \ I am cold again.
Slowly learned lessons \ are in-side the computer \ my ya-goo-gally
I know what you did \ the voice sounded of violence \ it was far too close
Anxiety strikes \ The monster can't be escaped \ The beast is inside
The flights of the wingless \ made with such reckless fervor \ seemingly worth it but for the end
O ' anxiety \ A fleeting feeling of death \ simply discomfort
Sitting in silence \ passing gas on my zafu \ everything is fine
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck \ shit shit shit shit shit shit shit \ it is finals week
Yay Roller Boogie \ It's on the t.v. right now \ Linda Blair can skate
The morning angels \ Welcome me to the new day \ I want to sing back

Doubting what I know \ Costing money I don't own \ Asking where it goes
"light milk, dark coffee \ swirling storms on jupiter \ become golden brown"
Trees swallow the sun \ still on my way to nowhere \ another day passed

"Chattering guns \ Bickering men,thunder-claps \ Calm dugout, tea break"
waves of rain \ dogen's words \ down the roof of my hut
i would only take away your peace \ to mention the soft greens \ of these leaves
You never came back. \ It's felt like rain forever. \ You seemed happy here.
Something deadly knocks \ The gates open discreetly \ Silently it leaves
"Confront everyday \ She breathes, she moves, I notice \ me An unseen ghost"
It is refreshing \ yet sad to feel again that \ which was forgotten

Kids sit up at night \ Admiring bright satellites \ Thinking they are stars
"Dread horns into night \ The river, three mouthed, trembles \ The Antler Prince rides"
The truth is the truth \ nothing replaces the truth \ it is what it is
What is existence \ A massive coincidence \ Or a master plan
My heart flutters by \ Into another's soft palms \ I hope she likes birds
Connect with others \ We are bigger than ourselves \ We are more than us

Narrow strip of sky \ Christmas lights glint in the deep \ As they always will
I am important \ I am special and unique \ shouted the masses.
"Struggle, work and slave \ But my peace lies still beyond \ always out of reach"
Light in the tunnel \ like a fish out of water \ I breathe in too much.
In the light of day \ A beautiful soul appears \ Only to rescind

To express oneself \ In 17 syllables \ Is very diffic
Those pillows won't fit \ They're firm your backpack small. \ Who's laughing now
I'm half a Pisces \ One fish with a severed rope \ And a broken heart
So far away now \ From my old favorite place \ The moon is the same.
I often forget \ It's okay to be happy \ I realize that now
"Sleight, the hands best move \ is met with nature's embrace \ the magic is dead."
Sweet summer sunrise \ the days gone past oh so fast \ now snow starts falling
Tops of mountains lost \ Nestled in the folds of fog \ Cozy high above
Tidal clarity \ The memory of your smile \ Pointing at the moon
"Unsurprisingly, \ horrifying apathy \ finally prevailed."
"Dark, rich garden soil \ worked with hoe and hands and heart \ from seed to table"
The conflict raged on \ I chose my weapon with care \ Paper ground my rock
"Perfect reflection... \ Leaning against the oak tree, \ where the river pooled."

A vicious tide rips \ across the frazzled coastline \ like time's ebb and flow

I gently stroked him \ lovers lying on the floor \ never to meet again
"Green shoots reach for sun \ like a child reaching for love, \ yet snow still floats pass."
A Haiku story \ About my best friend and I \ My only true love.
I feel your heart beat. \ Sometimes it matches with mine. \ Sometimes it doesn't.
Wind rippled river \ pruney fingers playing too \ long in the water.
Social beings seek \ Another to share our thoughts \ Without it we're lost
Men living bright lives \ Fighting far from their young wives \ Fodder for cannons

Ugh Monday again \ Yet another bleak work week \ Then it starts to rain
Office boredom sucks \ Productivity dwindles \ Employees go mad
"Lecture crawls forward \ Droning, his words mean nothing \ My own world beckons"
Hum and rattling \ of checkout line customers \ Please get them away.
I woke up naked \ Between cereal boxes \ The store is busy
See our souls shattered \ always oil and vinegar \ I saw solid gold
a shattered teacup \ we finish eating without \ mentioning her again
Sharing my music \ You'll have to remember me \ when you're listening
I turn on my TV \ I look down at my cell phone \ am I even alive
"Webs are everywhere \ It s a good year for spiders \ For flies, not so much"
Rain beats down outside \ With a natural rhythm \ My favorite song
My Milkshakes Bring Boys \ Could Teach But I Have To Charge \ They're Better Than Yours
Early morning rain \ Robins patrolling the lawn \ Worms on the sidewalk
Another day where \ I try in vain to stay real \ Leaving existence
She took her bra off \ She took her panties off too \ She had a shower.
Friends lost forever \ don't defend those in the right \ convenience strikes
hearing nothing \ how awful hearing nothing \ how beautiful
in tai chi it s taught \ what's stuck steals our attention \ out of proportion
Sometimes I slip out \ Walking through the cold night \ And I think of you.
I wanted to ask \ why post poems in the title \ and not the text box
"Rain falling gently, \ the drums and foot steps in sync, \ wish you could be here"
Overnight shift sucks \ But I have some dro at home \ My night should improve
western wind prevails \ a cold winter on its way \ I wish you were here

Sakura are shed \ Magnolias in full bloom \ Slimy paths ahead
"Tendrils hug the coast \ the cultists chant ancient hymns \ welcome, great old one"
"i, a fiddlehead \ once, in a previous life \ an inward spiral"
footsteps on the sand \ slight breeze from dark eastern sky \ the ebb takes the blood
I am a god who \ people have not imagined \ not yet spoke of me
"Even though I know \ you don't feel quite the same way, \ you still feel something."
The night ends at last \ But sorrow clings on yet still \ Death is eternal
What is a haiku \ I really have no idea \ Someone please help me
Fishing with my friend \ The fair lake favors his line \ Beautiful sunset
Eight in the ev'ning \ fatigue drains from my body \ leaving me empty
numbers jump around \ mathematics a pristine game \ that the whole world plays
sitting in a class \ the boredom only equals \ precious time misplaced
My girlfriend's fat aunt \ Sends us emails with words like \ Acrimonious
A lone stone goddess \ Stands watch over sand and stone \ Nothing else remains.
Moments are like waves \ Memories course through my thoughts \ Ripples of my past
laid my weary head \ to rest upon her shoulder \ gave in to the warmth
Peeing outside \ A reflection in the puddle \ The moon
I climb to escape \ Meditate in low branches \ My difficult tree
Picture me perfect \ The way I wanted to be \ The way I couldn't
Dream logic hallways \ Viewed through grainy video \ Glide with no tether
Why are everyone's haiku 5 \ 7 \ 5
Port Authority \ A vortex of misery \ Thanks for your patience
i left part of me \ i feel like I need it back \ it's by your bedside
"Slowly spring unfolds \ Winter fights every step \ Now, a weak snow falls"
desperation seeps \ he picks up my putrid scent \ and is drawn to it
It s quite warm for March \ The low sun casts long shadows \ On the painted wall
You'll never know it \ But you were my first since her \ Greys Begin To Fade
I used to smell the rain \ now I only step outside \ to spit between drags
We just barely met \ I'm not really complaining \ But we should slow down
fleeting is the thought \ here a second till it's gone \ thoughtless I remain
Schizophrenia \ I am losing my brother \ I can hear him cry.
Click this hyperlink \ to read a haiku I wrote \ for my cat La Forge
Former colonies \ the prison and the spice field \ leather versus oak
Tears rolling down cheeks \ Computer screen glowing brightly \ Lonely thoughts at night.
Leaves turn brown and fall \ Colors of the forest change \ The tree remains tall
Twelve hours of darkness \ is worth it to see the light. \ Good morning sunshine.
"Time gets faster now \ No time to feel, only think \ We forget ourselves"
A slice of apple \ Rests on my tongue so I may \ Savor the sweetness
sense is for the sane \ the proper and the civil \ here we are all mad
Under the night light \ he ignites the saviour \ problems become blurred.
I am still alive \ Though barely breathing through it \ I'm not dying yet
Waiting for the dawn \ I'll be better tomorrow \ When will I wake up
Pooped my pantaloons \ embarrassing walk backwards \ God damn Chipotle
The weight presses down \ the journey ahead is long \ I sigh and move on
There is no perfect. \ if you look for it you'll fail. \ accept what you have.
Felt down and horny \ Thought I just needed quick love \ Realized I'm lonely
Listen to the trees \ As they rustle in blue skies \ And the Huvan wind
Sensationalized \ Torn tangled twined turned twisted \ These lives we carry
congrats mom and dad \ you raised a racist fratboy \ phi beta dipshit
Failure tills the soil \ Learn the lessons sow the seeds \ The plants will bear fruit
"When I go doo-doo \ My bathroom door is see-through \ Therefore, I see you"
Discworld is orphaned \ Rest In Peace Terry Pratchett \ childhood companion
The smoke disperses \ I feel the motivation \ To do nothing now
A few days ago \ I looked at the sky and thought \ Never left my head
foul this midnight oil \ i prefer the scented kind \ pressed into tired bones
Heaven mirrors Hell \ My path set forth by kismet \ Dualism deceives
Even though I know \ every hug could be the last \ i am still right here.
all these moonlit nights \ have some secrets to tell you \ don't fall to slumber
We hug. We cuddle \ I fall hopelessly in love \ Such beauty are we
i do remember \ what you may have forgotten \ forlorn yet forlong
Everyone we lose \ Imprinted like heart moments \ Pining nostalgia
It is dark inside \ But the moon shines brightly there \ Where I was before
An orange and white shirt \ my teacher is a creamsicle \ melting in the sun
Victim of your love \ Time and scar tissue mended \ The hole in my heart
All hardwood floors here \ Where does kitty pick to puke \ Of course the one rug
I understand but \ I still don't like waiting for \ over two hours
Boring Thursday night \ Currently living alone \ Empty tissue box
What we remember \ It pales in comparison \ To what we forget
Look over my screen \ and out a distant window \ a tree starts to green
Working while eating \ My desk is my lunch table \ I should take a break
My cat Mylo stares \ Deep eyes penetrate through me \ What is it he sees
The rain hits my roof \ Inside I hear its patter \ Outside it melts snow
Through the open window \ Crisp morning air chills my skin \ As it warms my soul.
Many Haiku here \ But so sparse are the comments \ It's so darned quiet
"The joy of my heart \ Where have you gone little one \ Lord, please give him back."
Sometimes I miss you \ but you are a cheating whore. \ Give my sweater back.
One day the rain woke \ Me up high above the ground \ Thunder inside me
Oh April is here \ I May talk to her this time \ Or is it too June
"Open handedness, \ Generous as the blossom \ Strong, a Mothers love."
Holy cow I forgot \ There's a haiku debt to pay \ My fingers must work
"sometimes, showering \ I wish I could wash away \ and hide down the drain"
Blanket of cars \ inching along. \ Urban glacier.
"On the train to work \ Men, breath of halitosis \ women, too fragrant"
I told myself to \ Write one haiku each day so \ that's what I will do
"Closet skeletons \ Open the door, liberate \ Breathe in, fresh new start"
He rides to escape \ He rides to conquer himself \ He rides on alone
This should be simple \ until reflections arose \ as he met his gaze
Another Haiku \ I was Lazy I'm Sorry \ It Was Laundry Day
Find Death s business card \ In the middle of the street \ Get hit by a bus
stark raving madness \ calm collected and serene \ mine insanity
"I m a game show wiz \ Craigslist for fifty, Alex \ What is NSA"
Always mind your roots \ Many a willful oak was \ Lost through their decay

At the frequency \ 2.45GHz \ water is heated

Laying down for rest \ Rising for dreadful labor \ The cycle repeats
The road of life bends \ Unprepared for the sharp jolt \ I spill my coffee
Sometimes all it takes \ Is a single offhand glance \ To change your whole life
this is not a gut \ it is really a beer tank \ for a love machine
A glassless window \ a purposeless creation \ you left me unwhole
To my widowed wife \ I chose not death over life \ but death over you

No happiness exist here \ No sadness exist either \ What a dull life lived
I like your butt lots \ It's nice and smooth and perky \ I want to touch it
Sweet smelling red rose \ how I yearn to caress you \ ripping my hand's flesh

"There is a swift click \ Time lapsing, a distillant \ Compressed eyes need sleep"
I look to my past \ There is brightness and sunshine \ But today is grim.
Tears soothe burning eyes \ Overcome by passion's flames \ All just a mirage
Hoping to reach you \ I wrote my words on birch bark \ and set them aflame
the hardest part is \ forgetting those you swore you \ would never forget
"Mile upstream from you \ Thoughts adrift, wondering if \ Either of us k new"
Clarity of thought \ Illuminating darkness \ Truth reveals itself
darkness surrounding \ with no luster to be seen \ hope for light one day
"a gust of cold wind \ dying flame ashes remain \ part of my past, lost."
"there are two of me \ one is easily discerned \ the other, you leave"
An old sake set \ Dark green with a ruddy glaze \ Used to drink green tea

a red sun rises \ beyond ice-laden branches \ the northern wind howls
"dreaming in the dark \ dreaming funny, furry cats \ and of pretty girls"
"As I gaze upward, \ a vein of stars glows above \ and flows north to you."
Forsaken at birth \ The world seems too alien \ How do I exist
You like potted plants \ And maybe a well written haiku \ Enjoy your new mug
"Depression, I have. \ It is not heavy sadness, \ but numbness instead."
Don't speak her name here \ I'll remember how it hurt \ And how I miss her
"Like the shore and sea, \ touching, but always apart, \ we pull and recede."
when I see you there \ out of reach but still close by \ excitement fills me
Just another day \ My heart crumbles and mind breaks \ Such great depression.

Over on Facebook \ For a year only haikus \ omg this sucks
On my way back home \ i miss my dog and my girl \ it was nice to leave
"At the end of night, \ where streetlights grow like tall grass, \ I found you waiting."
I love you so much \ All that I want to do is \ Get drunk and hold you
Toast is burnt \ black as a piece of coal \ love carcinogens
As the birds flock south \ A never-ending sun sets \ And my time will rise
Will my past mistakes \ Prevent me from achieving \ All of my desires
Best present of all \ family not coming up \ Christmas is cancelled
That moment after arrhythmia \ heartbeat returns to normal \ a new lease on life
"Any haiku will \ Sound good if Zer0 reads it. \ Right, subreddit guys"
My future prospects \ Bright like shining stars above \ Behind clouds mostly
The lifeless bodies \ Falling forth like leaden rain \ In practice at least
The land of the free \ and the home of the frightened \ of North Korea.
"Grendel has been slain \ His arm hangs from the ceiling. \ Rest In Peace, Asshole."
Like the bird of fire \ I wish to be reborn and \ reach some place higher
 \ r \ movies banned me and made me apologize in haiku in order to lift the ban
just before bedtime \ my friend's baby so happy \ to bang on the bell
Christmas is coming. \ Forget presents. All we need \ to be together.
"Before I met you, \ love songs were just words and notes \ but now they're alive."
"So still my own pulse, \ It moves my hand hanging limp \ Alone drunk, sitting."
Frost in the desert. \ A name etched into the sand. \ Pobert. No. Robert.
"Underneath, Cloudy \ A few Flakes whip in the Wind \ Eyes, Heavy with Her"
Moon in puddle now \ chased by water drop stars \ kitten shaking paw
"Bow legged and hunched, \ the hermit comes to rest on \ a mossy boulder."
At the Spider Inn \ All flies are welcome to rest \ On the finest beds
"He lay still, tattered \ Seeking, looking, just one gasp \ Godspeed strapping lad"
Farewell Suder. May \ your death bring you the peace you \ never found in life.
Reading on the couch \ cat sleeping on my ankles \ purr-fect contentment
A moment of peace \ we had such a silly fight \ is this truly love
"Where did the moon go \ Someone left it in my yard \ tiny, still puddle"
Wake up reluctant \ Too cold to get out of bed \ But I have to pee
"Tired souls gather \ Blank stares dead words on bright phones \ so near, yet so far"
I'm ignorable \ I am ugly as fuck too \ This is my haiku
"Grow strong from within \ Stand firm, branch out, endure, thrive \ Majestic tree friend"
december snow day \ the kitten's pneumatic breathing \ keeping time for me
"2 cups on table \ Back again, where it began \ Table for one, please."
Music starts to play. \ People smile and dance away \ worries. Joy remains.
Waiting for the shrink \ About to spill out my heart \ Why is it so hard
Viewing Christmas lights \ Glisten like tiny jewels \ Through my tears alone
The wolves are calling \ Howled be their holy names \ As three protect me
"In her hands I could \ realize just how pale mine were. \ Now, they're just pale."
"Been through a ringer \ It is time, let me dry out \ Worn but still wearable"
Winter frosts over \ This journey radiates warmth \ Summer left in wake
"thou are the flower \ our eternal love, the stem \ the journey, the thorn"
Trusting her my flaw \ Enchanted by her beauty \ We all make mistakes.
"Society shuns \ The unknown, the unwanted \ Welcome to Facebook"
A half-empty glass \ Is half-full of potential \ Best served with passion
You're like inception. \ I wake up in a new dream \ each and every day.
In the fading light \ I sit alone and wonder \ what I could have learned.
Where did my youth go \ I have my grandmother's hands. \ My soul is still young.
the chi flow through me \ meditated for quite long \ oh it's vanished
Having met this girl \ I have felt so incomplete \ I should ask her out.
"Winter. More winter. \ I blink. Spring, summer, fall gone. \ Winter. More winter."
Sometimes I feel like \ a seagull in a snow storm \ white on white and grey
Let's lie and plug in \ To each other's fantasies \ Lost in the pillows
A sunrise smile \ Able to brighten the room \ And part stormy clouds
brought it on myself \ I fell in love way too soon \ does she love me back
"Fly buzzes too close \ Man swats it dead, just as a \ Cow swats fly with tail"
This Haiku's the best \ There's never been one better \ Nor will there ever
two little white moths \ cruise softly by my campfire \ November evening
Every great journey \ Begins with a single step \ Strap on some good boots
the broom is broken \ my dog sleeps on it's old bed \ furs are on the floor
"My circuits alight \ A poem idea that's bright \ For you, this I write"
Twin pools blue as ice \ twin depths unknown freezing and \ cold will they not thaw
The water bowl full \ silence greets the traveler \ alone with the moon
Clouds laugh til they cry \ At jokes told up in the sky \ Over our heads
Petal percher \ Virgin of the tomb \ Flutters forever
great skies over my head \ all the birds are singing now \ too blue to be true
Filled with energy \ A non-stop rollercoaster \ It's just so boring
life is the calm that \ precedes a violent storm \ of retrospection
"using a haiku \ generator, does it work \ can anyone confirm"
i fear my government \ take my hand my dear good friend \ we fight this bad band
The tranquillity \ That comes from the purest source \ I drink from your eyes.
Lost in the city \ My dreams and hopes await me \ Should have brought a map
She left. I can't sleep. \ My daughter moved to Japan. \ One out of the nest.
Late every night \ We looked up towards the sky \ But there were no stars.
The first kiss of snow \ Delicate upon the house \ Lips as cold as ice
turkey and a ham \ eat till that belly bursts wide \ then eat some more pie
Placing my ear to \ My cat's tummy to hear the \ Sound of crackling fire
you are who i want \ i hope that you want me too \ it will take some time
If you punch a cop \ you will probably be shot. \ Even I know that.
Flower on my head \ My face a fine garden bed \ Petals for a nose
Your eyes are a fire. \ a blue flame that sees inside \ my heart and my soul
In the morning sun \ Flights of leaves take off like birds \ In the winter wind
Love is confusing \ makes me want to run away \ but only with you
cat on countertop \ the owner won't discipline \ makes me want to kill
we met long ago \ you were the man in my dreams \ i still remember
I find peace inside \ even in the heat of war \ I find solitude.
Is it so bad then \ For to be misunderstood \ Is the sweets and sours
Electric dancing \ Cool blue coursing through my veins \ Lightning on my feet
"I seek to cure what's \ deep inside, frightened of this \ thing that I've become."
knowledge is power \ some things are not symmetric \ is power knowledge
Smoke stacks in their mouths \ Tobacco noose around necks \ Courting the reaper
Golden leaves \ shedding dappled light \ - precious moment
Need to break routine \ The monotony must stop \ Maybe rob a bank
You say you'll never \ go home. But the truth is that \ you never left it.
Small gardener \ your memory sleeps in \ autumn leaves
"Future streaks across \ the sky, a bright meteor \ past but dim shadow"
It's only money \ You cannot take it with you \ Winter cuts deeply.
Your words break on me \ like arrows to a mountain \ I will not be moved
"Standing on the edge \ of a well leading inward, \ I can only sigh."
Our conversations \ were complex and awkward and \ simple and perfect.
frowning dinosaur \ a dilapidated pet \ no cow big enough
As the seasons change \ every leaf on every tree \ falls into the mulch
Fancy armor does \ not help. The sphinx's eyes see \ straight into your heart.
first solemn snow falls \ to find earth to melt away \ and finally rest
It's nine-eleven \ I feel unpatriotic. \ Bombing in toilet.
I can make you laugh \ But because you hate my guts \ I can't make you smile
Waiting for finals \ Ready to fail so hard \ Fuck should have studied
at the beginning \ and the end of this poem \ a cat in my lap
the thief left it behind \ the moon \ at my window
"Count all the pebbles, \ When you can t find any rocks, \ Let alone boulders."
"My super power \ Aiding conversation flow, \ And well-timed nodding."
I woke up smiling \ and it took just a moment \ to remember why.
"How are you They ask. \ I am not doing so good \ turns into fine, thanks."
"Fine line in between \ Fantasy, reality \ Intoxicating"
Completely truthful \ about his dishonesty \ I trust him for that.
A tree had to die \ so they could make a barrel \ to age this whiskey.
Cool autumn porridge \ Pain au chocolat in hand \ I hear the tram's hiss.
My church is simple \ I tell you my sins and seek \ heaven in your bed
clouds release their rain \ violent winds suddenly arise \ the dog needs to poop
I am not myself \ but not not myself either \ trapped alone with me.
"The bronze coloured leaves \ Floats down the streett, as the wind \ Whistles your way home."
Socially awkward \ Making everyone else suave \ My gift to the world
Gone laughing mad \ With dancing crimson smiles \ I really hate clowns
What happened to you \ everything was beautiful. \ but then you got scared
Every single \ Dream of you splits the seconds \ I'm only awake
I am drawn to her \ the same way a moth is drawn \ to an open flame.
The past forgotten \ The present passing right through \ The future a haze
Rotating password \ Complex enough for safety \ Kills the n00b's phone
When you clear a jam \ Do it very carefully \ Because you can die
"My dreams are skittish \ I'm unsure of what they mean, \ but please don't wake me."
Tom Magliozzi \ Your Dart is waiting for you \ Laugh the night away
Amidst urban sprawl \ lies a beating heart of stone \ there is no way out.
"Stardust in full bloom, \ the universe subjective. \ Matter moves matter."
Hello anyone \ Have you an invitation \ To haikuary
A fear of falling \ Cannot be felt from the ground \ It shows you've climbed high
Hallowe'en night rain \ whipped by chill autumn wind. \ Sadly no thunder.
Million raindrops fall \ loudly but not enough to \ drown her I love you
The silence kills me \ Long pauses after questions \ Like do you love me
"This girl in my bed \ Means nothing to me, but you \ Wouldn't care at all"
Eight hours of work \ Until I start the weekend \ Seems like forever
sitting at a desk \ my hands do not create my \ sorrowful mind sighs
"one night, silently \ the heart will break come morning \ you will find it gone"
Kansas City cheers \ the Royals will take the crown \ been twenty nine years
"Remember to breathe \ If nothing else, one moment \ again and again"
following the sound \ of the bell with the bell -- \ still missing something
Fuck My nose is clogged \ Goddamnit I cannot breathe \ I have no NyQuil
Coffee burnt my tongue \ as my cigarette burns red \ like the autumn leaves.
Given enough time \ all mysteries are revealed \ given enough time
A haiku a day \ My internal reflection \ I still have questions
remember the past \ when life was calm and peaceful. \ where did it all go
looking for old sparks \ but there are none to be found \ a new fire has lit
Sweet and strong and kind \ he is after my own heart \ as he's collecting
"Sitting in a chair, \ waiting for enlightenment \ autumn leaves fallen."
"I am leaving now \ do not fear, I will be back \ say's his pokerface"
psychedelic day \ everything exists together \ I am but one man.
Headlights shimmer \ rain-soaked pavement. then gone. \ stillness unbroken
Leaves falling from trees \ Like ideas from the mind \ of one without belief
Never eye to eye \ Neither they nor their equal \ Yet opposite fears
Damage into strength \ Solitude forged into bonds \ That makes a phoenix
All love becomes rare \ all our little fantasies \ erased by a frost.
Code unreadable \ A stable and silent compilation \ Dragons in the code
What was the start of \ all this When did the cogs of \ fate begin to turn
You ride very well \ on that fine looking high horse \ but let's walk awhile.
"Weird Nap , a memoir \ Of a narcoleptic chimp \ Who learned sign language"
Each drag burns different \ but in the final moment \ they all become wind
"Overcast and grey \ Who has made my world today \ Let us,-slip away"
"Pine, Pecan and Oak \ Listlessly whisper secrets \ As I sit, inside."
Truth need not be deep \ but an ego's delusion \ can be abysmal
The river runs deep \ A perilous flow prevails \ Safe in the shallows
Self-immolation \ Keeping everyone else warm \ Burning yourself out
early autumn wind \ shakes the black-holed seed boxes \ and nothing falls out
Preach humility \ With every reason not to \ Kneeling on bee's knees
I dozed of in class \ while the teacher was telling \ me how to listen
"Sleep I do avoid \ For I dread the coming day. \ A bit longer, please"
Going with the flow \ Like a sheep follows the flock \ Straight to the slaughter
turquoise black twilight \ shadows sharpen colors fade \ nightfall soothes my soul
You are beautiful \ and without even trying \ you are amazing
"Dimethyl Ethyl, \ rolls off the tongue so nice. What \ exactly is it"
Garbage splashing through \ gutters full of acid rain \ Mouse lifts head last squeak.
Lone goose lifts her head \ lonely cry haunts empty lake \ October twilight
"Let me be your god \ Crucify me, stone me down \ Crown my head with thorns"
"Nose up my nostril \ His purring chest upon mine \ My cat, my best friend."
At night I keep my \ closet door ajar so that \ the monsters can't hide.
Met you in a bar \ Though your face is still in mind \ I've lost your number
the dry tortugas \ is such a magical place \ i fell in love there
you waited for me \ i will wait for you as well \ please don't be so scared
A cold empty bed \ Holding you is but a dream \ Maybe tomorrow
A train rumbling \ I do not want to sleep yet \ When does it arrive
Your strength is my strength \ My glory is your glory \ This is my prayer
Light like piano \ playing softly in my chest \ Our crescendo grows
Seated on high horse \ Looking down on everyone \ Hypocrisy reigns
Everyone will laugh \ at your funeral when they \ find out how you died
I am losing sleep. \ The stars don't shine through cloud \ in the winter months.
Fear of missing out \ Connectivity fetish \ Roses are unsmelt
Sharks circle the tank \ Inventors step quite lightly \ TV before gym
She's pretty girl \ she is now out of my sight \ Her bright smile lingers
When death comes knocking \ You can jump out the window \ Or answer the door
All the king's horses \ They could never be traded \ For all the king's men
Hashtag Depression \ Social network therapy \ Please share and like me
"There is nothing wrong \ everything is as it is \ even though, it sucks"
It's Colobus Day \ Everyone adopts monkeys \ Did I get that right
Important friendships \ are difficult to begin \ while staring at screens
Perspective shifted \ No more rose coloured glasses \ Jaded or greener
I'm new to haikus \ Security days are long \ yes i'm bored at work
Fired from my job \ pool water filling my lungs \ an extinguished man.
burning shouts ignite \ aching hearts tire of pain \ fall welcomes new hope
I won't lie to you \ if you'll show the courtesy \ to not ask questions.
His online presence \ Slowly fades away from me \ What will I do now
Just ripped a mean one \ and strangely it smelled of rice \ Made me want to write.
"Fire reflected on \ shadows of the birds, sweeping \ orange sky at night."
"lungs teeming with smoke \ choking, then coughing you out \ peace in the smolder"
That hill-line of trees \ have caught up in their branches \ an indifferent moon
What makes a conscience \ Society shapes and moulds \ But they could be wrong
Give a lot of love \ for giving is receiving \ and you deserve it
Now you understand \ Why we don't draw on the wall \ We're out of crayons...
"My hands, they are sore \ The nemesis goes away \ I restart level"
A three word haiku for \ r \ trees
As a physicist \ I searched 'haiku' on Google \ Objective complete.
tormenting voices \ malicious words betray her \ his love speaks clearly
To be everything \ while also being nothing \ just another day
I sometimes wonder \ does a haiku need seasons \ if the place is space
The breadwinner bees repeat \ The buzzword of the week \ Hive mentality at its best
The world is a blur \ Why am I always busy \ Sleep eludes me still
My dreams will happen \ if I focus and work hard \ or take a long nap
Counting syllables \ Haiku poet wannabe \ Plays with words daily
You cheated on me \ Broke my heart a thousand times \ But I love you still
Garden of feelings \ Emotionally unkempt \ Weeds choke the flowers
Polyamory \ Always completely open \ She still got hurt though
Power down low now \ Sinking softly south in sand \ Time's firm grip loosened
Drowning in sadness \ I woke up tired of life \ What do I do now
My mind drew notice \ As a tremor hit my foot \ How brief can life be
I've said it before \ And I will say it again \ I've said it before
I knew a summer \ she was always hot and wet \ just like the season
I have realized \ that these poems are senryu \ rather than haiku.
I knew an Autumn \ she was beautiful but cold \ much like the season
Mental traffic jam \ Not going anywhere fast \ Take the train next time
Infatuation \ Delusion makes your heart pound \ Actually empty
My pillow is shit \ I can't keep living like this \ I must get some sleep
Come to class later \ I want to sit next to you \ So our knees can brush
"You would make a great \ Father, she said, eyes glowing. \ But I don't want to."
Hi IT help desk \ Can you reset my password \ Sigh ok one sec
I may seem a douche \ Bragging whenever I'm right \ I've been so wrong before
Feeding on men's tears \ Misandry fuels the black heart \ Loneliness awaits
"Do you count each time \ Checking syllable numbers. \ One, two three, four, five..."
Lived in a dreamworld \ Thought it was reality \ Now I have wet sheets
Man with broken arm \ Struggles to eat chipotle \ Fuck Bill O'reilly
Pacing in the woods \ The leaves blow around my feet \ Such tranquility
Autumn's chilly breeze \ Sprays color across the yard. \ I hate raking leaves.
"he wakes - her side, cold \ sunrise kisses her soft skin \ he envies warm rayd"
"pollluted words cease \ his embrace, her heart grows warm \ their love never ends"
malicious throats ache \ sharp tongues slice their sacred love \ warring mouths breed pain
"water flows within \ earth channels without, for now \ I understand it"
Pants off netflix on \ taco bell is in my mouth \ this cost three dollars
A people machine \ put in experiences \ out comes behavior
"Mind, body, and soul \ I love every bit of you \ but mostly your ass"
"Satisfy yourself \ Using nothing else, but the \ Touch of your two hands"
She wore thick make up \ To cover his mistakes too \ Hers washes off though.
"I'm really relaxed \ I'm cool as a cucumber \ Indian cow, calm."
Social media \ I am having so much fun \ I exist notice.
Where did my faith go \ Sinking down the deep blue sea \ But I see the light
Autumn and winter \ are two beautiful seasons \ except for winter
The sky is so nice \ It is indescribable \ And a shade of blue
"Leftovers again \ sour smell, pale consistency \ has been a long day."
Organic life crushed \ society's pressure kills \ we are corpse diamonds
No one can stop me \ Not even syllable rules \ I am unstopa-

"I see the runner. \ He is running through my dreams, \ and away from me."
cruisin f'ra bruisin \ ran my motor mouth nonstop \ burn'd the engine out
My siamese twin \ has never seen the sunlight \ dead in my belly
horizon walled \ away by black thunderclouds \ blinding sunshine here
rainy morning blown \ away by gusting wind \ summer reminders
With each passing beat \ Waves of electricity \ Send currents through me.
The sexiest part \ of a girl's body is the \ thing between her ears
Enumerating \ Endless possibilities \ Unquestionably
"Many things go, so \ they said in the days of old. \ Yet, it's here I stay."
A stupid cyclist \ ran a stop so I hit him \ cause I am the wind
Monosyllabic \ girl says Yeah. Nah. Like. Um. 'Kay. \ And I still love her

an ode to Napa \ i miss papa joes pizza \ cheese and root beer please
"I see your haiku \ your syllables, incorrect \ down vote for you... damn"
"Lo, I did behold \ a sight unfathomable \ my phone's screen was cracked"
gloomy cloud cover \ city only wakes halfway \ sun died yesterday
still bright golden sun \ sinking slowly behind tree \ still want a jacket
Two men washing hands \ A public bathroom facade \ Don't judge me for not
thinking of fight club \ while shopping at ikea \ can't buy this nice couch
Where did my bones go \ They were here when I last looked \ Perhaps dogs ate them
dreaming by yourself \ takes you away from the world \ remember others
Halogen halos \ Suspended on beams of steel \ Guide my way tonight
we collect the stars \ but we keep them in the sky \ where there is more space
hoping to impress \ I make up constellations \ Orion's anus
hands beneath our heads \ we gaze at the starlit sky \ our elbows touching
i try to control \ that which itself controls me. \ i fail everytime.
stoned out of their head \ laying in chamomile patch \ watching the chickens
They said I was smart \ I just coasted through classes \ Mediocrity
Those who cheat advance \ while I stand stoic and alone \ a slave to myself
"The wind blows today \ From behind a closed window \ We all wait, breath held"

Down in the courtyard \ tiny green helicopters \ fall from the maples
The snail slowly climbs \ the rain-battered windowpane \ onward and onward

never permanent \ in a constant state between \ the even and odd
So many of us \ work just like Jesse Pinkman \ on his wooden box.
We shoot video \ to try to capture moments \ we should be living.
Victory's embrace \ Better than defeat's stab \ Or stalemate's handshake

Bratwursts so tasty \ but they brought me so much pain \ gall bladder gone bad.
I can't feel my feet \ My legs feel like jello cake \ back to the trees
Save me from myself \ while day drinking can be fun \ take away my phone
You don't know alone \ the bed is always empty \ the breath is my own
From sweet to salty \ Those bitter nights we endure \ Leave me paralyzed
I just found this place \ So many good haikus here \ I'll be here again.
Hearts heaving for heat \ The last breath of summer sigh \ Rain and leaves fall down
full bloom persimmon \ sways in a zephyr tonight \ shines in the moonlight

A bar called silence \ Drinking is an illusion \ In the dreams island.
Violets are blue \ Like high mountain streams run \ Glaciers undone
What I'm hearing is \ Please be tolerant of our \ sad intolerance.
So many wears masks \ Hiding intentions and truths \ But tears reveal all
In a bed of coals \ Wrapped in a blanket of snow \ Writhe in dissonance
Crisp snow falls anew \ To cover the dark dirt slush \ Pure white once again

Got this ink pen here \ Picky choice for some reason \ Wasn't for haikus
Never ending beer \ cavorting busty redheads \ mental vacation
The okapi runs \ across the African plains \ majestic as fuck
Empty pints lay strewn \ Failed attempts to fill my heart \ For love lost to me.
Would that i could speak \ Thoughts eclipsed by your presence \ forever unsaid
my bed is empty \ you were the bars to my cage \ now I walk alone
the Moon's white skirts whirl \ in deep remembrance of Him \ oh dervish of night
Fireworks are best \ when viewed in the reflection \ of a child's wide eyes
For better or worse \ Land of confusion is mine \ American born
irrational fears \ Flesh fondlers from the moon \ Kittens armed with drugs
"Slip into the night \ wants, needs, hopes, fears, blended thoughts \ wake to grasp at mist"
If blondes are bombshells \ Brunettes are the explosives \ Blow me up baby
Alliteration \ All about an appliance \ Aromatic art
When the mother dies \ One must learn to hunt alone \ Suckle not the corpse.
all of my nightmares \ came true because i believed \ in them more than dreams
Hat made of tinfoil \ Bananas between the toes \ Euphoric weird-o
close enough to touch \ my skin silent without hope \ yearning patient flesh
If the bear breaks wind \ The butterfly's wings fall off \ Lament your flight plan
I eat the candy \ which dissuades wonders for what \ tomorrow might bring
Dear mighty queen bee \ plastic flowers starve the hive \ your empty thrown room
Listen closely to \ maniacal lyricists \ their blood is golden
He is a bad guy \ But he is my great master \ Cooking an apple pie
A handful of sand \ endless struggle is fruitless \ damn insomnia
I've got good coffee \ for thought provoking visions \ but I'm still lazy
For work it's a must \ for social life it's a curse \ punctuality
In a blue mood \ The only noise is the wind \ Silence is loud
Oscillating fan \ Serving better as white noise \ than what it's made for
Was left just because \ now the bottle calls to me \ this is all bullshit
The water rises \ more to do with much less help \ work is cement shoes
sharp tears fall from sky \ parting air like frost on grass \ the kiss of Winter.
why is there sand here \ buried deep in my pocket \ without ocean scent
On a rainy day \ Building castles in the sky \ Waiting for the tide
Singing birds \ Sunset in Seattle sea \ Happy words
A world divided \ yet we stand on common ground \ knee deep in bull shit
"I sit here alone \ Waiting, red lips quivering \ Faith wavers, hope lost."
Start another war \ to shift public attention \ from the spy programs.
I don't like haiku. \ Counting syllables is dumb. \ Poetry should rhyme.

Once upon a time \ there were Nazis in Europe \ i'm glad that's over

four day weeks are ace \ nobody says ace ever \ but it applies here
Syllabic fortress \ Writing growing too constrained \ self-referential
Disappointment is \ a most disturbing ailment. \ Cure it with some hope.
"When deaf, dumb and blind \ your prettiest pictures are \ painted in your mind"
This wondrous gift \ imagined fleeting fancy \ passing too swiftly
How to stop a fox \ a pistol in your pocket \ I got you chickens
You must learn grammar \ English department orders \ I'm afraid needs must.
NASA lets poets \ send haiku to Red Planet \ on a MAVEN's wings
looking for a list \ of songs written in haiku \ can you think of some
My body screams \ the smelliest thought of that unforgettable river \ a fart
Sitting in a rut full of hay \ I look down at the sun \ The sun in the spiky hay
I sit in awe \ Thinking again \ How I wish everything could end
How did the Scarecrow \ know he didn't have a brain \ L. Frank Baum's plot hole.
All clocks are hungry \ Helping themselves to seconds \ Eating up my time
Repeatedly lost \ brainwaves function like hay stacks \ my mind says goodbye.
Kill the monster in the dark \ let the scars of the past be \ see the future in the eyes
Showed friend some haiku \ said it needed seven lines \ no comprehension
now i am the void \ destroyer and the destroyed \ beyond conception
Trying to move on \ But every thought I have is \ What if you come back
Even when it sucks \ I still have the tendency \ to long for it back
"Cuz you're a rhino- \ -ceros, stampeding through the \ mess that we've all made"
Yawn...I am a cat \ The sun's rays caress my back \ Birds sing napping songs
"wheel of terrorists \ turn turn turn, tell us which group \ to pitchfork and burn"
Broken on the rocks \ Discarded marionette \ Wonders what went wrong.
I've been up all night \ You will never even know \ You're the reason why
Young lady April \ butterfly over the sky \ sense of flutter chill
Yo mama so fat \ I can't even describe it \ No words will fit her
Think for a moment \ of the star-filled emptiness \ That envelopes all.
I don't want to talk \ About the things we've gone through \ Though it's hurting me
I didn't even fart \ My hands smell like bleach \ The air smells like dirty farts
I intend to write \ one haiku every day \ to get me flowing
Rise above the law \ The tendrils of mutant seeds \ On land of the free
She whispers a dream \ Against the lips of my mouth \ Time to wake up now
"A return to weights \ Lifts, curls, presses, shrugs, pull-downs \ Joints creak from misuse."
From the summit of \ sinuous water wrinkle \ silvered moon flakes wink
Red handed twilight \ Flexed breath of a sweaty breeze \ The criminal skies
Beneath an old bridge \ Father Nero yells at rats \ And awaits reply
Renewal of spring \ brings life to my weary soul. \ A flower in bloom.
"Knowledge is a key. \ What is a book to a man, \ who cannot read it."
"The stench fills my lungs, \ I can t navigate my room. \ Don t miss laundry day."
"Will you remember \ Me, a ghost of your childhood \ The friend left behind"
A crumpled bumper \ coats of red on the dashboard \ and into the streets
Leafs mostly green \ reflected in the pond \ and orange fish
The stars in the sky \ Watch silently from above \ As you dance below
She slipped off her shoes \ Sitting nearby on the floor \ He knew he loved her
Cut off my man-horn \ And Glue it to my forehead \ I am unicorn
Winter turns to Spring \ Songbirds return to make love \ Man alone envies
Bags of human ears \ resting on the mantlepiece \ Daddy's war trophies
Up to bed early - \ His empty chair still impressed \ with his company.
There are more slaves now \ than there ever were before \ we bought all these things.
How can I dislike \ these Facebook advertisements \ without getting sued
A quaint deception \ Plotted by corporate greed \ Are you a Number
Finding old pictures \ and wondering when I ll stop \ wanting that pink hair.
Winter s gray stays - like \ heavy gravity crushing \ earth s inclination.
Female cardinal \ by no means less beautiful \ but simply less red
"It's St. Patrick's Day \ Did the parade tip me off \ No, the vomit's green."
Life in paradox \ Must write to keep persisting-- \ No patience to read.
Day s first train whistle. \ Radiators wheesh - dogs stretch. \ Hills in silhouette.
"Piercing the brown ground \ sharp, green leaves A false fragrance \ drifts by like a ghost."
"My dog outside in \ the dark morning. Unnoticed, \ the cat dashes by."
My daughter disguised \ in last year s costume - the hem \ now up at her knees.

"Outgrowing the house, \ we rearrange furniture \ to deceive ourselves."
Woodstockish playlist \ wallow in hippie goodness \ one toke o'r the line
"The dawn trickles in \ like unwanted company. \ Politely, I rise."
Shocking stunned silence \ Mouths agape swallow crushed hearts \ My word the trigger
The cracks of my soul \ are caulked with fleeting dreams \ that live in the stars.
The sunrise sparkling \ behind the hill. Bare trees still \ immersed in the night.
The Fading of thought \ The days begin to repeat \ you're already dead
Love is a deep hole \ the only bottomless pit \ worth falling into
Haikus can be fun \ But they don't always make sense \ Refrigerator
"When a man stumbles \ he does not forget, though he \ dwells not on the past"
Peering up at them \ Beneath their countless bodies \ The stars ignite me
The infants heartbeat \ fluttered uncertainly while \ a mother begs god
Kaleidoscopic \ thoughts coalescing crystal \ in my search for zen.
"Oh the clarity, \ sobriety has now brought \ a new waking life."
We are getting cold \ Better enjoy the given \ and forget the lost
"I recall a child \ Drunk on the sweetness of life. \ Alcoholic, now."
I beg forgiveness \ my ignorance knows no bounds \ I am a new face.
Fear and ignorance \ are the great oppositions \ to truth and knowledge
For my life I cry \ For I met the perfect guy \ His heart is not mine
Cold steel rips through me \ I fade into the darkness \ Only to be born
it's hard to express \ ship an over-night feeling \ the cost is too much
"small orbs in the sky \ flickering, moving, dying \ we are the same dust."
Hands held in the dark \ We can't bear each other's gaze \ This is sharing shame
ideas overwhelming \ like ink on a page \ but not words or shapes
"Soy un perdedor \ I'm a loser baby, So \ why don't you kill me"
Unrequited love \ Can I really call it that \ perhaps it's just lust
religious people \ should get to park where they want \ it's a handicap
To have touched the heart \ And felt the soul of the world \ Breathing inside me
Chomp Chomp chew swallow \ Silence was all that was heard \ Gulp goodbye my pet

The birds chirp sweetly \ in the trees by my window \ I wish I could sleep
Wedding bells ring out \ Snow white dove released from cage \ A man's dream wilted
Sleeping is my drug \ My bed being the dealer \ My alarm the law
4 I lie here speechless \ Gaze fixed upon the heavens \ The sky beckons me
3 As the night unwinds \ I can not help but wonder \ If you're with the stars.
"Sexy, spunky girl \ tolerates my silliness. \ Means the world to me."
As the sun rises \ I look to heaven's wonders \ Grateful for today
Night falls in winter \ silent snow canvas of black \ birdsong bursting forth
The birds sing a song \ That is uplifting and bright \ In this world's darkness.
Perhaps a window \ or perhaps a mirror bright \ words fly to paper
The sky and the cloud \ Two companions through my life \ Artists up above
A parting of ways \ A bittersweet heart still beats \ A confusing life
Oh how dreams haunt me \ Show me false reality \ Life lived in fake time
With claw locked in beak \ Crushed in a landslide they keep \ Fighting Forever
A spherical shape \ The sun's bright essence contained \ Within a white orb
Migrating birds meet \ On the water's green sloped shore. \ Water treatment plant.
